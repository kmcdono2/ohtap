      "AM: But they didn't, they didn't think I should have answered him back, you see. Well anyway, there was struggles all the time, white men trying to molest us all the time, you had no peace from white men. I remember my brother, this was a brother, my father's son by a previous marriage, he went and got with the boss's son at the big sawmill, who had insulted me. That was an insult for a white man to say he wanted you, that was an insult, you see.\n",
      "3 ['insult', 'insult', 'insult']\n",
      "AM: I had about eight, you know, from the different marriages. And he married my mother... My father's father was a white man. His mother had been raped, you see, on the plantation, And so he was the son of a white man. CG: Now what was his name? AM: My father was St. Cyr Moore. Father was a very handsome man, about six feet tall, and broad shouldered, very powerful man, powerfully built, very good looking, extremely good looking. And I understood that he married my mother more out of spite than anything else. His second wife was one of those...they call them octoroons in New Orleans. That is, you couldn't tell her from white. Obviously the daughter of a lot of raping in that family. And my mother was your complexion, and this was supposed to have been a cardinal sin, for a man of his complexion to marry a brown woman. And so the prejudice was very high against color in the South. The light-skinned people felt that they were superior to the black-skinned people, and this was taught to us, it was taught. Everything that happened in your life was to demean the original people, the African complexion. And the ones who was mixed with the white blood was better. It's a terrible scourge; that was, again, an injury against us. They added insult to the injury; after raping us, then teaching us that we were better than the black ones that had escaped the rape, you see? So this always had somewhat an effect on me. When Marcus Garvey came on the scene, then of course a deep consciousness was awakened in me. And I recall the lynching; my grandfather was lynched. CG: Ah. Your father's father or your mother's father? AM: My mother's father was lynched. My grandmother's husband was lynched and... CG: Now was this the grandmother that you went to stay with?Ã¯Â»Â¿5 AM: Yes, that was Grandma, and you couldn't tell her from a white woman to save your life, which shows all the rape that went on in our family. You know, I mean with our people. CG: And he was lynched? AM: Yes. He was a black man, he was very black, and he was lynched for standing up to some white people who wanted his land. This was all it amounted to, because after he was lynched they ran my grandmother off the land, and she had to take her five little children and flee for her life with the things they had on their back, nothing else, leave everything, their cattle, they had cattle and everything on her farm. So all of her children, Grandma had to place them with white people. Now white people in those days, the French whites, they had a custom of having a little black child in the home to play with their little children. I mean people who don't see the prejudice against black people today can't understand this, that they would rather have a black child play with their children than for their children to socialize with the little white child who was lower in rank than them, you see?\n",

EMS: Vicksburg, Mississippi. TD: About how old were you then when you saw that?... EMS: I was seven or eight years old. We dare not to talk about it, we dare not to say anything, it was just there, what the gasoline... TD: As a child, if you were seven years old, somebody must have told you.

TD: Attempted rape...a seven-year-old child does not necessarily know what attempted rape would be. EMS: No. Because I doubt it seriously if they used the word rape back in them days. TD: What word did they use? EMS: I think they used the word that they insulted a white girl. TD: I see. He insulted a white...insulting is a little different from rape. EMS: I know, but he asked the question and insulted her, and we knew what that meant, because we didn't know the word pregnancy, what that meant. They were just saying that the girl had broke her leg, and I was so dumb, I looked to see was her leg broke.

      "My mother was champion for all. The principal of our grade school could look out from her third floor, which is the Edmund Meany Junior High now, but was... CAT: (cont.) Longfellow Grade School...from the top floor, I'd say three floors up...from her little cubicle at the top, she could look down and see my mother marching to school, and she knew that some child there of color had been called a name or been slapped, or had been insulted, and my mother was on her way there to defend this child. Not her own children, although she had to defend us, but any child who had problems. The same thing at Garfield High School. Any literature that was taught that was derogatory to blacks, she was up there, and that literature was taken out of the schools. MMG: These were materials used in the classroom. CAT: Materials used in the classrooms, like the poem, \"Study of the Negro Race\"... \"fat black bucks in the wine barrel room \"you know that one. She had her eye on the schools all the time. She was fighting for young people. For example, a boy was accused of rape. Mother had intended to be a lawyer, and one of the write-ups that we have of her with her picture in a book, is that she intended to be a lawyer...of course, she met Mr. Pitter and Mr. Pitter married her instead, and she was supposed to go ahead and be a lawyer, but I came along. This young fellow, for example, was accused of rape, and Mother went out into the area, and because of her color, and Mother had bright red hair and green eyes, and after typhoid, her hair was light brown. And so, Caucasians would not always know people who were black. She could go out as she could find out many things. She found out from the neighbors what type of people these parents of the girl were. She defended this young man and other young people as well to keep them out of prisons, because we didn't have any juvenile homes in those days. And because of her they went to reformatories instead. I have been told that if I could have heard her in court, that she could defend as well as any lawyer. MMG: Do you remember about the time period for this rape case? CAT: Let's see, this would have been in the mid-thirties, during high school. MMG: And this was carried in all the papers? CAT: In all the papers, yes. MMG: And what was the outcome of the case? CAT: The young boy was sent to reformatory school. There were others, too... not rape but, for example, a young fellow was picked up and he was six-foot five, or seven, something like that, for being a burglar, and Mother went down and proved how ridiculous the police were, after they described how the burglary was done, that a six-foot seven young man couldn't possibly have been the burglar. She was always doing this sort of thing. When a young man, a Caucasian, was murdered and raped here in the city jail, the mayor asked Mother to please be on the committee to help to plan the juvenile court. She accepted and she helped to plan the court that we have now. MMG: About what time was that, do you know?... CAT: This would be in the mid-forties. \n",

It's like a--it's like somebody who is a rape victim or incest victim, unless they actually cleanse themselves and acknowledge it and cleanse themselves the pathology comes out in other ways.

      "Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is all your father's mother or, or-- Speaker 2: My father's mother. Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Speaker 2: My father--so he would say her hair was long enough for her to sit on and it was not a curl in her hair. And so again he would say she was whiter than any white woman that you ever meet. Her husband, my grandfather William Henry James [William James], was very dark complected which obviously gave birth to my uncles. My father was the second of four boys in the family. But back to my grandmother, it really wasn't until years later--I was a college student at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] when my father's younger brother Uncle Hilton, Hilton James--he was pastor of Berean Baptist Church in Brooklyn, New York. They're a prominent congregation in New York [New York]. Anyway, Uncle Hilton was at Hampton--Uncle Hilton attended Hampton and was very proud of the fact that I was matriculatin\n",
      " at Hampton at that time. And he was visiting and we were--he was telling me about his mother--and because I said daddy said that--that--gave--talked about her attributes being so fair skinned and he said, \"Our mother wasn't fair skinned. Our mother was white.\" And I said well what's going on with that. He said that back in--I would assume Fluvanna County, because that's where she was born, my grandmother. They were three little white girls and they were raised by a woman that was very, very dark complected, Grandma Johnson [ph.] was their mother. But there was really no way that--and I'm using Uncle Hilton's words now that she--Grandma Johnson could've given birth to those three little white looking girls. So--but Grandma Johnson worked for a family in Virginia and she lived out in the back, and apparently this--someone in the family--a woman in the family or it could've been a couple of them had babies out of wedlock, had white babies--this is not miscegenation, this is not, you know, rape or incest, this is just someone who had babies out of--white babies out of wedlock. And in those days you lived up to the country like they lived. Every time this woman had a baby or one of these--it could've been sisters, it could've been just one whatever it wasn't clear. But every time there was--yeah at that time say illegitimate baby born, they would really in what essence toss the baby to the back yard to Grandma Johnson to raise. So, in essence, my grand- great-grandmother was raising these three little white girls for this family until circumstances occurred and Grandma Johnson relocated to Richmond with these three little girls. And one of those girls was my grandmother, Annie Carlisle [ph.] her--it was pronounced (pronunciation) Carlisle but it was Carlisle, is how you would spell it, Johnson James [Annie James] and Aunt Edna [ph.], who I did meet. I never met my grandmother but I did meet Aunt Edna. So I--if those kinds of stories are painful especially for people at that time--my father was very upset that my uncle shared that with me because I think he was more upset because of the fact that she'd be viewed as an illegitimate. I mean those days oh my god it was like--it was just such an insult. And he preferred to really think about my mother [sic.]--my father did, just during the time that she was, you know, married to his father and then raising them. Speaker 1: That's interesting. Yeah. We have a lot of stories that are not told (simultaneous). Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm sure. Speaker 1: But when they're told things make a whole lot more sense. \n",

      "Speaker 1: So, you were covering sit-ins and you called Percy Sutton and what happened? Speaker 2: Yeah. I, I called Percy Sutton to simply just ask him could I join and go down with the group, but he said, \"No we don't want any coverage you know, you don't need to go.\" So, I went of course. So, it was so ugly. It was so--the minute I got to this diner. It was a diner, this diner refused to serve blacks, so three men were behind the counter. \"Y'all can't sit here, we don't serve niggers.\" So, it, it, it's, it's still shakes you up. You, you hear about it, you read about, but every time it happens it shakes you up again and say I can't believe what I'm hearing. I can't believe this is now, this is today. I can't believe this kind of hatred exists. All of this goes through your mind, but here it is these terrible people. They knew in advance, of course, that the, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] leaders are coming down there. They didn't know a female reporter was going to be there, so I'm sitting there and I'm really frightened 'cause I'm seeing maybe for the first time the worse kind of hatred and anger and, and possible killing. I'm seeing this vividly, vividly, just by the language, the way they insulted, the things they said and how they said, the men behind the counter of the diner, which was--to these NAACP leaders, who were trying to be served. They, of course, the leaders all anticipated this. This was all done on purpose. They wanted to be arrested. They indicated a little surprise at me being there. They--I was not known as an NAACP leader and it soon, and they soon realized that I was a reporter and so they said awful dirty things to me very loudly. And we're all sitting there, these, these insults are going back and forth, but we are waiting for the police to arrive that's why we're just there to arrest all of us. That was, that's the idea. Speaker 1: You included? Speaker 2: Yeah. Except when they came to arrest everybody, one of the policeman reminded another policeman that the law, I believe, he said says that when a woman is arrested she must be arrested by a woman cop, which may or may not be true. I'm inclined to believe it is, it was true because what advantage would it be for leaving me there. But, they arrested the men and I was left there with these terrible men behind the counter. I think there were five of them shouting insults to me that I cannot even repeat. I, I've never been that frightened in my life. I, I was, and, and I'm wondering if they're gonna rape me, 'cause that was suggested as part of the insults they were throwing at me. I said are these four men gonna rape me? Are they gonna kill me, or is, is this woman police person whose gonna arrest me is she really gonna come? And I prayed quietly. I didn't, I, I just prayed quietly, and, and was so frightened wondering could I withstand what I thought was gonna happen to me, could I try to kill myself. It, it was not anger that I had it was just plain fear, just plain fear, the worse kind of fear. Story_ID: 372504 Speaker 1: The woman cop came sooner than I had expected, thank God. Her name was Ms. Kennedy [ph.], Officer Kennedy. She handcuffed me, took me to the car, took me to jail, and put me in there. In those--I, I, I don't know if it was five minutes or ten minutes or fifteen minutes that I just, I just had to sit there and hear all these insults being hurl, hurled at me and wondering---I really, I really was wishing for a way I could kill myself because I was thinking the worse kind of things, but none of that happened. God intervened and going to jail was a piece of cake you know, it was heaven (laughter). And they, we had a trial the next day. Speaker 2: Did you have to stay overnight in jail? Speaker 1: Um-hm. Speaker 2: We're you the only female? Speaker 1: Huh? Speaker 2: You were the only woman. Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: Were you-- Speaker 1: I just stood up all night in some little jail. Speaker 2: So you had a trial the next day, okay (simultaneous). Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because that whole thing was at night. I don't think it was a long night. The sit-in had started at night, so I, I don't think it was a long night. I do know I just stood, stood there and held onto the rails and had the trial the next day which lasted about five minutes and we were all found guilty and fined a hundred dollars each. Speaker 2: What was the paper's [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] response? Speaker 1: Hm? Speaker 2: What was the newspaper's response to your being arrested and fined one hundred dollars? Speaker 1: They just did a straight story on it. I didn't want it dramatized or anything. I, I, with me I, I don't, I don't, I, I wanted, I didn't get killed, I didn't get raped, the worse did not happen. With me I thank God and we don't need to dwell on my personal fears.

This special section was, you know, completed per se, and this photo essay that I, you know, had been working on, you know. And Ralph [Earl] Graves came in to look, to review it. And he's walking down, walking along the wall. And the editor is explaining--and then they come to the photograph of Eldridge Cleaver. Graves went ballistic. \"We're not having a convicted rapist in Life Magazine. You know, \"How dare you?\" Blah, blah, you know. \"He's nobody's leader, he's no new spokesperson.\" Blah, blah. \"He's a convicted rapist\", or whatever, you know. And the next thing I know, everybody is looking at me. The editor's looking at me. It's like it was if I was the only one who thought that, you know, Cleaver should be part of it. And I finally said, \"Look, I don't like that he's a convicted rapist. So, that does not necessarily mean that therefore he is not a spokesperson or a leader.\" You know, I said, \"We have had leaders of nations who have done worse\", you know. \"And it is not up to you to tell black people who they should follow. That's not who you, that's not your place either, Mr. Graves\", you know. \"And there are a lot of black people in this country who consider him to be a legitimate voice for their concerns. I thought he was going to have an apoplectic fit. And then he, you know, he yelled some more. And I said, \"Look, Dr. Franklin, John Hope Franklin, was supposed to be the advisor on this, this thing that they were doing.\" I said, I said, \"So, why don't you ask, speak to Dr. Franklin? You know, who am I? I'm a nobody. Ask Dr. Franklin, you know, what his opinion is.\" And I remember Graves stormed out of the room or whatever. The editor I remember said to me, \"Well, dear, you know, if you had thought that maybe there was going to be a job for you at Life Magazine, I think you can forget it.\" It was true. You know, I thought that I was really was going to get to be a reporter there. But after that incident, I knew I was mud. The upshot was Graves talked to Dr. Franklin, and Dr. Franklin told him almost essentially what I'd said.

      "Speaker 1: But there are many things that went on at the Georgia State Prison [Reidsville, Georgia]. I'll just give you an example of the, the cruelty of the, the place, the shocking cruelty. There was, the, they have classification systems in prisons. And the classification system by type of crime, violent, those kinds of characteristics. The Georgia State Prison had a policy of placing the young inmates, the first offenders, in with the homosexuals, because they said they didn't fight as hard as the older prisoners, and it was a way of pacifying the population. So I got, this is outrageous, I got a letter one time, an anonymous letter from someone who said there was a young inmate who had been viciously gang raped in the dormitory and that this inmate was writing to say couldn't we help to try to get this kid out. So I called for the--an opportunity to meet this young man, and he came out, and he was not as big as I am, he looked like he didn't shave yet, little young, in for car theft, first offender. He was obviously, mentally, completely out of it. I mean he couldn't, he was having hallucinations because every time I talked to him he was doing this, looking around, he was hearing voices. I talked to him for about an hour, trying to get him to say anything. The only thing that he said, I said, \"If I could get you out of here, where would you want to go?\" And he finally said, \"Home.\" So I wrote on a yellow pad a temporary restraining order application, I served it on the warden, and then I appealed to him as a human being. I said, \"Look, you know, we can go and try to torture the judge into having a hearing, and, and do all this and get the lawyers involved.\" I said, \"But surely you don't want a young man just to be viciously gang raped over and over again in your institution, under your own humanity. Won't you please move him?\" And so they moved him, but listen to what happened. They moved him from the open ward, where he had been victimized, to the hospital floor, and they locked him in a cell so that nobody could get to him. Now this is inhumane for somebody who's mentally deranged and, and needs help, but he's at least protected from people being able to get to him, so I thought. I learned about a week later when I came back to the prison, that at night the inmate orderlies had the keys to the cells, and that they had victimized this young man while he was up there in the hospital floor for his own protection. Now to me--we later got him sent to a mental hospital. And I hope that they were able to do something to restore him to sanity. But to me, that is a classic example of the kind of vicious inhumanity and disregard for people. And any system that would treat young people that way, or have a classification system like that, is an abomination. Story_ID: 611913 Speaker 1: So when we hear things about prisons and conditions in them, it may be to say, well, there are a lot of bad guys, there are a lot of bad guys, I've met a lot of them. But there's so much more than that that is at issue and at stake, and it's--not only the treatment of individuals, it's the kind of society we insist up on having and we've got to fight back and push back because look at, look at what this is doing to black people, the increasing numbers of women, the disproportionate impact on our young men. It's, it's a vicious, vicious system. So that's one example of the kind of suffering that I saw. Here's another minor example, because I had just, I've, unfortunately a mind full of these stories, which is a terrible thing to carry around in your head to remember them. But I went and talked to, because there was an outbreak of tuberculosis and so we had filed to try to force the prison [Georgia State Prison, Reidsville, Georgia] to test everybody to see did these inmates have tuberculosis. There was one very handsome, tall, young brother whose name was Eugene X [ph.], he was a Muslim, and he was found with tuberculosis. And he had been coughing and hacking, he looked so pitiful and frail when I first met him, and they did get him some treatment. A couple of weeks later, I was talking to another inmate and I said, \"Well, you know, at least they got Mr. Barber [ph.] some care for his tuberculosis, and everybody has been tested, and so I feel better about that.\" And he looked me in the eye, he said, \"What?\" He said, \"I was his cellmate for a year, they never tested me.\" So you see the indifference with which human beings lives and wellbeing. I don't think that we put these people in prison so they can develop tuberculosis or be gang raped. It's, it's, they may have done things that were wrong but there's vicious cruelty. Story_ID: 611914 Speaker 1: Now my life, I think, was saved by a death row prisoner. This is an interesting tidbit. This is a white man. His name was Troy [Leon] Gregg. He was one of the lead plaintiffs in a case called Gregg versus Georgia [Gregg v. Georgia, 1976], in which the death penalty was upheld with standards, and this must have been in 1976. Troy Gregg was on death row at the Georgia State Prison [Reidsville, Georgia]. He was in there, I think because of felony murder situation. Meaning that he, that he and somebody else had robbed, the other person killed whoever it was, but Gregg was held equally liable for the death as the one who pulled the trigger, and so he also got the death sentence. He was a poor, low income guy, lived in a trailer, and sort of fit the stereotype of the, the poor southern white. But he was willing to testify about the harassment and treatment of black inmates on death row, and also about the conditions of confinement under which he suffered. I'll skip to the chase. On the day before a hearing that we were going to have on conditions of confinement and death row, I had insisted to the judge that the death row prisoners be transferred from the prison to the courthouse in, in order to have the hearing, that it was inherently coercive to have this hearing at the prison, and that they, like everyone else, should be brought to the court. And the court had ruled with me, although the defendants sorely objected. So we had the hearing. And but, before the hearing, Troy Gregg told me he said, \"Listen, Lynn [HistoryMaker Lynn Jones Huntley],\" he said, \"I know that they're planning to take the death row prisoners to the courthouse--to Tattnall County [Georgia] courthouse.\" I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Well, I'm going to tell you something that could get me killed if it got out,\" he said, \"But you seem like a nice person, and I know you're just trying to help us.\" And I said, \"Really, what is it?\" He said, \"Don't take the death sentence prisoners to Tattnall County.\" He said, \"Something is going to jump off, and you could be really hurt.\" And so I took his advice, I went back to the court, said I changed my mind in view of their delays and blah, blah, I would have the hearing for the death sentence prisoners at the Georgia State Prison. Fast forward it's now four years later, I'm working in the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] in Washington [D.C.] again in a trial section involving prison and jail litigation. I'm reading Corrections [Today] magazine one night, and there is an article: Troy Gregg and two other inmates had escaped from prison, from death row, and he was found murdered and drowned in a pond not too far from the prison. Now I don't know whether he was part of a conspiracy to escape at that time or not, but something tells me that when he told me that that's exactly what he was doing. That he knew, although he was under sentence of death, or life in prison, will never get out, that he saw something in me as a person and his humanity was touched, and he told me the word that perhaps had kept me from being in harm's way. So that shows you the complexity of doing this work. These are human beings and they have faces and voices and handwritings and names and not all of them are the, the vicious animals that we are portraying them to be. Many are people who have simply gone the wrong way, and it's a vicious system. \n",

And that's really--the kids in the juvenile justice system, I'm gonna tell you a story about the juvenile justice system and the link to the child welfare system. So, a young woman--and this is a young story that's not about a particular girl but it could be about lots of girls in the child welfare system and in the juvenile justice system. So, most of the children who are physically or sexually abused are abused by some man that they know, you know, the mother's boyfriend, the uncle, the cousin, whatever. So, a, a girl is abused, sexually abused and is taken away, put into the child welfare system, put into a foster home, runs away from the foster home, wants to be home still, wants--you know, runs away from the foster home, runs away again, is put in another one, runs away again, ultimately ends up on the street. What do you think she does to keep herself alive? Speaker 2: Prostitution, yeah. Speaker 1: What she was taught, right? Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 1: So, when she's picked up for prostitution, no one ever looks back and says, how did this child really get here? What's the trauma in her life, you know? And, and she becomes one of those kids that everybody wants to look down on. Whose fault is it, you know? And so that's, to me, the number of kids that are in that situation in this country that we don't know about, we don't talk about, we don't care about is I think just outrageous. So, yeah, we gotta--we've gotta do something about it even though there's not enough money.\n",

      "ACEY: I'm trying to think. I think that I was a senior and she was a junior. I think I mentioned, my sister and I have lived in the same city, in very close proximity, for all of our lives, except for about two years when she was in graduate school out in Texas and Arizona. Rosary Hill was, as I said, in the suburbs, and there was no transportation. The buses ran, but they stopped at a certain hour. Buses didn't even run, I don't think, on the weekends. So the college culture in Buffalo ... not just at Rosary Hill, and probably in the United States, I would imagine ... was you hitchhiked. I remember hitchhiking from Buffalo to Albany to go see somebody. You know, we were hitchhiking together. My first years, before I moved off campus, I had a job off campus, and I would hitchhike to that job, and once a guy exposed himself. I used to carry a knife actually, but I don't know what I thought I was going to do with it. ANDERSON: But you still didn't think you were gay? (laughter) ACEY: It had a nice little leather holder. ANDERSON: Yes, I was going to say. ACEY: I forgot about that too. God, you know, the things that come back to you are amazing. So it was a culture of hitchhiking, and people were careful. I eventually stopped hitchhiking by myself. I didn't think it was such a cool, you know ... But sometimes you just got desperate though, you had to get someplace. Nobody had the money to have cabs, and it wasn't like New York where you just, you know, put your hand out. My sister and her roommate were going out for the evening to a bar, and they left campus and they hitchhiked. They got picked up by two guys, who drove them near where they were going, but pulled into the driveway at the state hospital, which is this big ... massive acres and trees and deserted and dark ... you know, long driveway. My sister and her roommate were in the back seat of a two-door car, and when they went to let them out, her roommate got out, they pushed her, and they drove off. Her roommate got hysterical and called the police when she got somewhere ... I can't remember ... and got some help. I worked my way through college. I mean, I had some scholarships and my parents helped me, but I always held down a job. I don't know how I did that. I used to take a lot of classes, be involved in politics, and work.

ACEY: I was running the student union that night and there was a dance. I got a call to come to the police station. I was with these close women friends, and I didn't have a jacket, it was chilly. My friend gave me her leather jacket and said, \"Wear this.\" And I went off, and I got to the police station and found out what had happened to my sister. She'd been beaten and raped. She'd been found in a park. There was an alert out, that she was in a park that was closed, with these guys, and the police were just doing a routine run-by of the park, and they saw this car and they investigated. So my sister was traumatized. There was a woman police officer talking to her and then to me. The guys who had done this were African American, and the police were saying some really outrageous ... So it was this, really, another one of those conflict-ridden, contradictory situations where both she, who is, like, bruised and beaten ... She was a virgin. She might have been a sophomore or a freshman. I don't know, (inaudible) personal history, anyway. So we got into an argument with the police officer, who had begun to make some racist statements, and I made the comment that, \"How can you say this? I was with friends, this jacket belongs to my friend.\" So I just said to them, \"Let's just leave this, let's just get out,\" because she had to get to the hospital, get all these tests. We're talking late '60s, maybe 1970s. I can't remember if I was of legal age, because I am a year older, but we basically didn't want my parents to know what happened to my sister, because we felt it would kill them, knowing that she'd been raped and brutally beaten. To this day we don't know. There were all kinds of knives and axes in the car, so we don't know if they intended to kill ... ANDERSON: So you were trying to protect your parents from the pain of that. ACEY: We were trying to protect my parents, which was, you know, probably the very wrong thing to do. And then within days, my mother and my aunt were coming to visit, and now this became a big thing. There was a big newspaper article that someone had been raped from campus. Nobody knew, so there was all this buzz on the campus. My sister is not in a great shape, we're trying to keep this from our parents. My aunt and mother arrive, and we go out and do something and we come back to my sister's room, and she's on the phone sobbing. What the police had done is to call my father and told him that his daughter was brutally beaten and raped, and his other daughter ... they made up some kind of story, and I can't remember. Again, I'd have to ask my sister exactly how it went, but they got in that his other daughter ... they got in the leather jacket and all that, but they kind of made it something else. ANDERSON: And African American friends too. ACEY: Yeah, they kind of made it an ugly story rather than how it was. So then here we are, my mother and Anna want to know what's happened and why was my sister crying. So that was like completely ... And Joanne, well, she had to go through three trials. She already had left Buffalo and gone off to graduate school, and they were flying her back. I think the first trial was a hung jury, and the second trial they were convicted, but then they got off on a technicality, an appeal. And then there was a third trial, at which they were, in fact, convicted. One, I think, ended up serving a few months, the other a year. So, ah, it was, you know, a big thing. I think I went through a lot of denial, you know? ANDERSON: Yeah. ACEY: A number of years later, I began to be more in touch with the feelings about it. Now I ... you know, fast forward ... I have become involved in the women's movement, through reproductive rights and sterilization abuse work, and then anti-sterilization abuse, and also antiviolence, women's antiviolence work, mostly around sexual assault and rape, but also somewhat around battered women. They were different organizations at that time, but the women who were doing the antiviolence work were very connected. Some are involved in both. So it was years later that I got more connected to what had happened, because I think I went into a very ... denial: [it] happened, [it's] over. You know, I felt like my sister needed to get some help. Initially she did a little counseling, but she really never, I don't feel ... The resources weren't there. She was treated terribly by the defense attorneys, treated terribly by the medical folks. There was no one place that I feel she got what she needed, and I think even from me. My parents were devastated, but again, there wasn't a lot of discussion about it. So years later I got more in touch with what had happened, kind\n",
      "of the hugeness of it. ANDERSON: Through the movement or through other personal work or therapy? ACEY: In working within the women's antiviolence movement. By the time I got involved with it, there were many lesbians, women of color. It was about organizing and advocacy but also services, but it was also about personal. So the more exposed I got to people working, but also women who had experienced some violence, the closer it got me to, like, begin to get better in touch and to begin to take in that experience in a whole different way. I remember distinctly one conference where there was a session that was women of color only, to talk personally. The opening question was, We're going to go around the room, and I want each person to ... if they can ... relate an experience of their own or of someone close to them or one they know. I remember there might have been about 40 women in the room. Every single woman had a story, and I was totally overwhelmed by it. Again, this is years later. We're maybe talking at least ten years later, if not more ... probably more ... since my sister's rape. I just remember just sobbing and sobbing, and then I started to talk a little more to my sister. Well, now we're talking, you know, well over 30 years ago. It still feels like it didn't get completely processed, if you will, so. \n",

      "And I think I clearly see that when I wanted to send my children to the school I'd gone to, and my husband and I believed in public education, and I went down to the local school, I saw that it was not going to be possible for me to send our children to that school. So I would either have to do something about it, or find a private school for them to go to. I think the saddest day was when I felt I had to take my children out of public school, and that was because a seven-year-old little girl was raped at the lunch hour, and she came into the school office and said, \"A man was playing with my pussy.\" And she had blood streaming down her legs, and she was crying. And the school principal, who was a woman of color, told her to sit down on the bench, went into the office, shut the door, and talked to the Board of Education legal department to see what her legal liability was in the case of this child. Nobody hugged that child. Nobody cleaned that child up. Nobody called that child's mother. Nobody called the police. They left that child for one hour sitting on the bench crying, and letting the blood keep down her legs. It was not until the next morning, when I had brought my children to school, and my husband was home sick, and I was standing in front of the school chitchatting with a few of the other parents. Somebody ... who I promised I would never divulge who it was, somebody said to me, \"You don't know what happened in the school yesterday, but you'd better find out quick. Let me tell you, a child was raped,\" and proceeded to tell me, and said, \"You'd better do something about it because nothing is being done about it in the school.\" So I said, \"Well, what are you doing about it?\" Well, of course he kept walking down the street when I said that. So I talked to the parents, and I said, \"We've got to do something. This is what happened.\" And everybody was outraged. But I realized what this little girl must have gone through. Nobody hugged her and said, That man was wrong; you didn't do anything wrong. This school principal convinced the mother to take her out of the school. And I realized how young women are not treated in a respectful way for what their feelings are or what happens. Now this was only one case, but as we were standing out there talking, a car came cruising along, and it was the local community relations policeman, and he was this wonderful Irish guy. He got out of his car, and he said, \"Well, Suki, what are you doing standing out here?\" I said, \"You know damn well what I'm doing out here. I'm telling the other parents what I've just heard about wha\n",
      " was going on in the school yesterday.\" So he said, \"Oh, you heard?\" I said, \"Yes, I heard.\" He said, \"That bitch!\" And I said, \"Excuse me?\" He said, \"She could have called us. The kid gave such a description of that man, we could have picked him up in no time because the kid gave such a good description of what the man looked like and what the man had on and what he smelled like.\" He said, \"We're furious.\" I said, \"If you're so mad, would you, please ... you're in plain clothes ... would you please go walking around the school and see who stops you, and check all the doors, see if they're all locked.\" So he said, \"Well, you know, they have to be able to open them from the inside out.\" I said, \"Yeah, but I want to know if they're locked from the outside so the guy can't get in. He got in somehow.\" So he went around, and he said, \"Nobody stopped me. Half the people don't know who I am. Some of the people know who I am.\" Some of the administration knew him, but the average teacher didn't know him. He said, \"Nobody stopped me.\" Now this was the day after a very serious issue. So the parents ... we got together, and we said, Well, we're going to have to stop everybody from going in the school. We discussed, What are we going to do? Finally we decided, Okay, we're going to have armbands on all the teachers, and we're going to tell the children they may not talk to anybody who doesn't have an armband on. And if somebody doesn't have an armband on, they should tell their teacher they saw somebody and give a description. And nobody can come in the building unless they agree to have an armband put on. Well, you know, you'd think this would be a perfectly reasonable solution. There were teachers who refused to put an armband on. \"I'm not going to wear something like that.\" Well now, if it had been their child that was raped, wouldn't they want to do something? We couldn't think of anything to do without disrupting the educational program, but we thought this would be perfectly simple. Teach the kids somebody was hurt in the school and not everybody in the school should be in the school. So I learned about the stereotypes of ... A teacher doesn't necessarily care about the children she's teaching; a teacher doesn't necessarily care about the issue. And so we ended up having to go to court because a few teachers pushed, shoved, accused us of pushing, shoving ... you know, got into a thing. Well, eventually the hearing officer, the judge, chastised the teachers for not doing what they should have been doing, and thanked us as parents for taking an interest. And that even annoyed me, because I thought, Why do you have a stereotype that parents wouldn't have an interest in their children? But there are so many ingrown concerns that people have about other people and how they act or don't act. And so we ended up closing the street, we ended up doing all kinds of things to have demonstrations, and finally they agreed to having somebody on patrol. Now, this isn't now, where you have guns being looked at or security things going on with the children. This was a little seven-year-old girl, and nobody protected her and nobody said, We're sorry. And she was whisked away, and she was sent to another school.\n",

      "STEINEM: That came about (laughs) in a typically atypical way, which was that the publisher who had published the first book, Outrageous Acts, had access to unpublished photographs of Marilyn Monroe, and asked me if I would write text to go with them. It happened that we also owed that publisher a lot of money, because we had used my book as a subscription premium and then not had the money to fully pay for those copies. So in order to pay the debt, and also because, like many women, I think, I had always had a kind of rescue fantasy about Marilyn Monroe, in the sense that, had there been a women's movement, would she still be alive? So many things about her were like exaggerated versions of many women's experiences: being sexually abused as a child; being abandoned by her mom ... a single mom; abandoned first by her father; and certainly being treated as an object more than a person in many ways, especially before she became famous, but even afterward. So if she had felt less alone in those experiences, would she have been able to survive? So I was also fascinated, but if it hadn't been for paying the debt and the photographs, I probably wouldn't have done it. I would have contented myself with a brief essay that I did for Ms. magazine about her\n",

      "TOURÃƒÂ‰: OK. As I recall, there was, in 1970 or '71, there was this big women's speak-out in New York, where all these women came and they talked about feminism and sexism and chauvinism and all of those kinds of things. And were kind of assessing, I guess, in a way, assessing the women's movement and identified violence against women as a really big issue, you know, not just ERA, for the equal pay thing, or the right to have an abortion, but violence against women, and out of that, the women who participated in that session, a couple of them came from D.C., and so they decided that they were going to start a rape hotline. ROSS: Do you remember their names? TOURÃƒÂ‰: They started the rape hotline in Jackie McMillen's apartment on 17th & Q Street Northwest, here in the District of Columbia, down in Dupont Circle, with this mustard-yellow answering machine. ROSS: Who was the other woman? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Took training. There was Lois Yankowski, Jackie McMillen, Deb Freedman. She came fairly early on, I believe. Val Jones, who worked with the Women's Legal Defense Fund, very instrumental in getting the first My Sister's Place started and all of that. It was a group of women like that, trained themselves to be able to work on a hotline and take the calls and they developed a very strong political analysis about rape and its relationship to power. All the things that everyone criticized women for having as part of an analysis of violence against women ... who now, the mainstream themselves, embrace a large part of that ideology or that perspective, that politic, or that analysis, however you want to say it, about that, that they didn't do before, Post Traumatic Stress [Disorder], you know, rape trauma syndrome, just any number of things that the women were saying in '72, '73, '74 went on for so long, that the more traditional society, law enforcement, medical, social, was rejecting all of that, have now had to come around and embrace it. And not just embrace it, but kind of like take it over and claim it, like this was their thinking, their theory, all along and all the time, which was just so outrageous, such revisionist history. In that house, in that apartment on Q Street, and it stayed there in Jackie's apartment for some time. And from Jackie's apartment, the first place it went was to that small, two-room across the street from Lincoln Junior High School on 16th and Irvin Street. ROSS: OK. There were some feminist magazines, and wasn't there a group called the D.C. Area Feminists Alliance? TOURÃƒÂ‰: FAAR. ROSS: Feminist [Alliance] Against Rape. Tell me about FAAR and ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, FAAR was ... some of the women in FAAR were from the Rape Crisis Center who had left the Rape Crisis Center, wanted to do something else or do some things differently, and so there were people who were interested in publishing, and they got interested because there was also a quarterly scholarly magazine called Quest. Quest preceded FAAR, you know, because it was more scholarly, a quarterly and all that. So you had women who worked on Quest who were interested in putting some focus around rape and so forth, and you had women who had been at the Rape Crisis Center who had an interest in putting out written materials and educating in that way, so they got FAAR magazine. The thing I'm trying to remember, because it had two incarnations, as FAAR and as Aegis magazine. And actually, what I think is that they became FAAR the collective. The magazine was Aegis magazine, and it carried articles and information on sexual assault and theory around sexual assault, you know, all kinds of tips, this, that, the other, different stuff, stories, articles that had to do with empowering women and all of that. Later, Aegis joined with ... oh, yes, and of course, dealing with pornography as well. Later, Aegis joined with domestic violence and half the magazine would deal with issues related to sexual assault, pornography, and the other half would deal with issues dealing with battering and domestic violence. ROSS: Did you get the sense that in the early years, the people at the Rape Crisis Center worked on other forms of violence that women experienced, or was it just gender-based violence? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It was gender-based violence. However, definitely gender based, although the Center did recognize that it was possible for a man to be raped, it was obviously not the primary focus, but there was certainly the acknowledgment that men could be sexually assaulted. You had individuals who worked at the enter who may have had involvement and ties into other movements around other issues, but the Crisis Center was strictly dealing with rape and had its hands full to deal with that, because in '72 and '75, I mean, the police, everybody, I mean, it was a battle. You know, if we ... it still continues to be a struggle, you know, but it was a battle. It was a war, you know, in terms of they didn't want you to have companions. I mean, all rape crisis centers, now you can have a companion with the woman at the hospital that's from the center. So, Oh, no, you couldn't do that. They didn't want you there because you impeded the investigation by being there. So then it was, like, the only way you could be there was if the woman requested that you be there. I mean, it was all these things, you know. Women asked for it. It was just horrendous. So they weren't just dealing ... they were not really making connections to anything else. They were dealing with the dynamics of gender, you know, and as time moves forward, began to ... around different issues, make connections, broaden out ... ROSS: OK. Now, you're saying that your working at the Rape Crisis Center affected your marriage. In what way did your consciousness that you developed at the Center cause you to re-look at your marriage? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It wasn't working at the Rape Crisis Center that caused me to ... I didn't need Rape Crisis Center. I mean, in all honesty, I didn't need the Rape Crisis Center to help me with that at all. When I was saying, working, I meant working in terms of the finances of it. You know, where if the man doesn't have a regular job or steady job and you do even just part-time, full-time, whatever it is, the dynamics that that creates. No, it wasn't a consciousness from the Rape Crisis Center. It was just the consciousness of, you got to go, because somebody's going to get hurt, OK. And so, I ain't fit for it to be me, so, and you're not leaving my child no place else, so you got to go\n",

      "Speaker 2: A person, I separate the person from the crime, and I tell jurors to do that. This person is a human being and they are afforded the dignity of a human being. The crime can be the most heinous thing in the world. I've had hate crimes where people have killed, you know multiple people. I've had people, I've seen maybe as a prosecutor or even as a judge, where people have done rape and murder and, and various other things and children are involved. But you still separate the crime from the person. And you're not here to judge the person, you're here to judge the crime. And that's what I try to impress upon the jurors. Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Speaker 2: And that's what I mean by that. Story_ID: 1316 Speaker 1: All right, all right. Let's see, well with what would have been some of the, I guess the memorable cases that have come before you as a Superior Court Judge? Can you talk about those? Speaker 2: Well a lot of mine, cause they were murder cases, they are on appeal. One case that is not on appeal is a homicide case that I can talk about. Is--it's kind of unfortunate. These two childhood friends and they grew up and went different paths during the dot com time. And the victim was making a lot of money setting up cubicles for all the dot com businesses and so forth, great deal of money. And he and his girlfriend got a little trendy little place, re-gentrified area and they were giving a lot of parties and probably had some drugs there and so forth. And so I guess he went back to his old childhood friend to get the drugs. And I guess the childhood friend saw a lot of cash being thrown around. And here the defendant and another assailant break into the house and rape and sodomize the girlfriend in front of the victim, she's a victim as well. Throws her into the closet naked and then she opens the closet door and saw the defendant put the gun to the guy--to his childhood friend's head and shoot him, and blow off his head. Then turned, opened the closet and shoots her in her stomach, where she's running and she survived. She runs out, and I hope I'm not getting to graphic, where she could see her intestines and everything hanging out. And what was so sad about--well everything was sad about the case. But sitting there in the courtroom watching family members from both sides, the victim and the defendant, and these people were next door neighbors. And they remember their sons being in Cub Scout together. That's very painful, that's very painful.\n",
      "1 ['sodomize']\n",
      "ASETOYER: Well, that's very heavy on your shoulders. It's always there. We have to look at what our families went through in that colonization process. We have to look at what our mothers and our fathers went through, what our grandparents went through, what our great-grandparents went through ... and prior to that, before a reservation, all the wars, all the violence, and the famine and the relocation. You know, we have to look at all of those things and how that impacts our community and our lives today. In boarding schools, there was a horrendous amount of corporal punishment that took place, as well as sexual abuse. Our mothers, our fathers, were raped, were sodomized, were violated by the priests within the Catholic Church. And prior to contact with boarding school experience, sexual abuse was unheard of on children. It was unheard of in our culture ... not to say that it did not exist, but from all the questions and research that we have done and all the interviews, that on the very rare occasion when something like that would surface, it was dealt with harshly. Abandonment, you know ... you were abandoned by the tribe. You were set outside the camp to survive on your own and that's it. You were disappeared. It was dealt with very harshly. The impact and the volume of sexual assault that occurred and sexual abuse that occurred in the boarding schools, you know, the rapes and the molestations, have had a horrendous impact on our culture. And the appropriate resources have not been provided for us to deal with it appropriately by the Indian Health Service or Health and Human Services. So, what we're doing is, we're, in our communities, starting the healing process, the dialogue, because of the impact, generation after generation, that this has had on our people. And it's very important to start that process of dialogue, to start the process of ceremony, to start the process of healing and to engage in that, because Indian Health Service, for the magnitude of the problem, is virtually doing nothing. And that, to me, is a continuation by omission, by omitting their responsibility, of the colonization process and the genocide and the ethnocide. And so, they're very guilty of that.\n",

      "Coming on further, I stopped over in Japan, that was the time it was occupied by the United States Army, and of course I didn't like the looks of it and was so pleased when that occupation ended. When it ended a few years later, I was invited by the U.S. Department of...well, AID, that's what they called it then...to go with a group of Indian women to Japan to see the extension services that they had developed, and they had done an outstanding good job in this whole field of extension. They had already had some programs along this line, in kind of a neighborhood way, but they had it much more organized, the government was in back of it. And the thing that impressed me the most was that I lived in the homes of the Japanese people and that's when you really learn a great deal. Having tea, seeing how well they took care of their children again, and I saw absolutely no child abuse, just none, no child abuse whatsoever. The children were loved and cared for, and they were helped to do things that they wanted to do. I saw no one scolding any children. I made a real point of that. Had you noticed that among the Japanese people? MT: Well, I wasn't there probably under the same arrangements as you had, but even though Japan had been through a war, the children weren't like children in India. FPK: No, they were not. They were very different. But you know, on the other hand, I think the war had been over about two years when we were there, and by that time, the Japanese people had been able to do a great many things to bring them back to their normality. I found there was no food shortage, the children were well fed, but more than that, they were well treated as humans, with thinking powers of their own, and their parents and the other adults appreciated it and also encouraged it. I felt very good about that, and believed that we could learn a great deal from the Japanese people on child rearing. MT: No doubt... FPK: There was no child abuse at all! No child abuse at all! \n",

      "However, they have found a way of involving me, and they put me on a community advisory committee, and what we're doing is developing a program, the Junior League program, of pulling together information about women that all women need, whether it's battered women or child abuse, or health services for teenagers, whatever. And they're going to get a mobile van which they will move around from neighborhood to neighborhood, bringing to women in each neighborhood this kind of information, centralized in one spot.\n",

      "I was teaching a class at Lehman College of City University one day, when a young white student came in and said, \"Dr. Stokes\"...I think I may have told this story before...\"I'm sorry I've been absent three weeks. I messed up a young lady.\" And I looked at him and said as he announced this in class in the midst of twenty-eight other students, \"Wasn't your relationship a mutual one?\" And he said, \"Yes.\" And I replied, \"Well, how do you mess up anyone when the relationship is mutual? Are you telling me that according to the Roman Catholic church, you have violated the ethical and spiritual teaching of the church?\" \"Yes,\" he said. ^ \"Well,\" I responded, \"didn't she mess you up?\" And that turned the whole session...and most of m-j students were white...into a discussion of, What is love? And what is physical abuse? And what is pleasure, and what is happiness? After two hours, I had twenty-eight young people leaving class, having discussed more frankly than they ever had sexual abuse and use, when they thought it was love. I started a pastoral counseling session in my office from then on for the rest of the semester. One young lady was ready to run away from home at eighteen to live with her cab driver friend. When she came in to talk about it, she wasn't really going to the cab driver as much as she was leaving the authoritarian conditions at home.\n",

      "MM: Can I ask you a question, then. So, you then probably had a bird's eye view of the church sex abuse scandal that went down with the Catholic Church in, what was it, the early millennium? BM: I didn't have any view of the Catholic church. I didn't have any negative view. I know loads of people were shocked that I worked for the Catholic Church, but\"¦ MM: Can you, can you clarify what years this was that you're working for him? This was\"¦ BM: What years? MM: Yes. BM: I think it was 1982. MM: To \"˜92 ... And then for twenty-five years? BM: \"˜82? At least until\"¦ you know, yeah, at least twenty-five years. 65 MM: OK. So the church does go through this incredibly rocky period then, while you're working for the bishop. BM: Yeah, and he had to, believe it or not, they asked him to write a United States workshop for all the bishops on it's abuse. I wrote it. I researched it. MM: That's fascinating. BM: And his secretary put it in Powerpoint. I didn't do any typing, I never typed. Even at Pembroke I didn't type my reports, I sent them all to my father, and his secretary typed them and sent them back. I'm not a typist. MM: (Laughs) So you basically produced the content, or help him produce...... BM: I wrote this, I wrote the things. Of course I did a lot of research. I read a lot of books and did a lot of research. But why ... he and I couldn't figure out why they asked him\"¦ to lead the whole workshop for all the bishops. MM: Why do you think? BM: I don't know. MM: Because he was liberal? BM: Because he was very liberal. In fact he'd gone to Catholic high schools, and said you know we, you shouldn't abuse the students who are gay. Not that he believed that they should act out their.... You know, after all, he was Catholic. But he ... I don't know if you know Vatican II. John, the pope. Pope John, you know was the one who started Vatican II. He's the one that said everybody should get health care. I knew ... I wrote on all the popes. When the French Revolution ... the first, the pope there, he wrote on the workers' rights. So you know the Catholic Church has been involved. So, Vatican II, the Church of the modern world, changed everything. Why they asked the Bishop to lead this, I don't know. But I wrote it.\n",

You don't know who you are at th-, at that age; you're just trying to find out who you are and just trying to establish a personality for me. I just lashed out at everybody.

But not in a major way, it's more in a control way, you know, sometimes I try to exert myself when I'm in the city council [Village Board, Oak Park, Illinois] or over my boyfriend or something like that in a, in a really nice way.

And, I eventually shared that with her in a repeat back to Oprah's show ['The Oprah Winfrey Show'], it's, you know, it's hard but that was my life, along with some of my sisters. My sisters were able to come through the abuse really well, but I--it took me a while and even now in relationships, you know, I'm a lot more cautious you know, with the kind of men that come into my life and things like that. I still have a good relationship with, with the people who abused me. I don't think of them any longer as monsters because, you know, they were going through transitions as well and it's just one of those things that happens in life that you just have to kind of like watch all of your children.

I mean, I, I dealt with any number of cases. We dealt with, not only divorces and dissolutions because we were a combined family court, but my toughest cases were dealing with bind over cases, you know, decisions where you had to, you had to make a decision about whether you help a juvenile in juvenile court or transfer them to adult court. Dealing with children who were raped by their parent's boyfriends or live-ins, some of the horrific abuse that I saw happened to kids. It, it was, it was a challenging court to be on. You can't even begin to imagine what people do, or will allow to be done to their children. It, it was shocking for me. And so, one of the things that I did, as I said to my staff, I said, \"You know, look, we know we have six years. I don't know if they're going to give me more than that, but we know we have six.\" And the one thing I know about black robes is when you put them on, suddenly, the media cares what you have to say.

That is his baby.\" And she looked at me, and she said, \"Why do you keep babying her about this? She can get over it. I got over it, she can get over it.\" This is this child's mother, and she forced this twelve year old--and I'm not saying it was the wrong decision, but she did it out of her own\n",

That's not going to happen.\" So, this twelve year old, tears streaming down her face, not even understanding what's happening to her. She had depression, she was raped by her mother's boyfriend. And her mother, instead of trying to help her own daughter get through it, was there trying to get her daughter to say something that would allow the boyfriend not to go to prison. It, it and then, there were so many examples of that. I can't even begin to tell you. Speaker 1: Yeah, that's unfathomable, you know. You'd think she--what would he have to do for her if they want to get rid of him? I mean, I don't know, I think, you would think that'd be enough, right?

But the court, the court can refer women to programs, but unless the woman really sees it as something she needs to go through, it just doesn't sustain. And that was part of our frustration is really--sometimes we'd have court orders over them, like if we had their children in custody, we could order mom into counseling, or into domestic violence treatment. And then, as a consequence of her not going, we could refuse to give her children back. But I had so many moms who didn't want their kids back. If they had to choose, they would choose the guy.\n",

There were all kinds of issues with them when they spoke out with me, but change occurred somewhat. And there was education that occurred, and women tell me that their working conditions are there are better. We went undercover there to prove that this was going on, and that there was a hostile work environment. We went undercover at Ford Motor Company [in Chicago, Illinois] when the women there came to me to complain that they were being treated in a hostile way, and we found evidence of quite a hostile work environment. Lawsuits were filed. The women recovered money. You know, so again working conditions hopefully are better as a result of the work that we did. And I get thirty calls a day from people who have real, serious problems or from whistle-blowers who want to tell about issues that are going on, and want to tell about how government isn't doing what it is supposed to do, or how they are being defrauded by the private sector.

Speaker 2: Well, you know, basically when someone calls me, I check them out and there's not very much that I haven't heard of or seen and so I just know how to track things down very quickly, and I sometimes do not have any evidence. For example, the story that I just told you about happened at a place called the Alden Village Nursing Home in Bloomingdale, Illinois. Actually, three years ago, someone called me with a similar complaint of sexual abuse, but I couldn't prove it. It never was proven, so I put it in my files, and when I got this call this time, I went straight to that file and I said, \"Now, this is call is pregnant.

      "In regard to DCFS, the Department of Children and Family Services, I was just at awe one day to realize how many children were coming into the system and were wards of the state [of Illinois]. Now mind you, when I was growing up, if \"Sally Sue\" wasn't at home with her babies, it was just somebody's responsibility on the block. We, somebody was going to take care of those kids. It was no such thing as calling somebody or sending some child away. It was a community effort to raise children. It was a village. It took all of us. But there appeared to have been a new-found method, in my opinion, of creating dollars to bring to the state and that was to get children, because drugs, drugs was becoming rampant in our community and a lot of families were falling apart and so we started reading about horrible things, women burning babies and throwing babies out the windows and father sexually abusing children and selling their babies for dope. It was just a horrible situation. But if that wasn't bad enough, once they get into becoming wards of the state, they were once again in some cases sexually abused and misused and some kids were being sent to five and six and twenty different homes and each home they went to, it was worse than the other, they was further being, they were sexually abused at home with their biological parents and now there's these foster families. They were being sexually abused and there were other siblings there, other children there, that is not of the same family and each is sexually abusing each other and it was just a horrible, horrible situation and it was making me sick. I looked at the system and I said to myself, \"Something is wrong here.\" There was no continuity. There was no way that families were really getting back together, there was no closure in what happened to the child. We were raising children to become greater predators. We were having them to leave DCFS [Department of Children and Family Services] and to become wards of the state again for the Department of Correction and it was a vicious cycle that, to me, that needed to be broken.\n",

So it was off limits. But I think if I had to really describe, I would say that it was a safe neighborhood simply because everybody looked out for one another. The most horrible thing that I can remember during that time and, and, and which has caused me to have some feelings about rape and child abuse, is that when I was about eight or nine, I found a little girl crying on Fourth Street between some houses that had been sexually abused. And I picked her up. I did not know at the time what it was, I just thought she had fallen and hurt herself because she was crying. And I'm packing her around the corner to bring her to some of the women who, you know, lived there, cause they looked out--everybody looked out for everybody else's child. And it was many, many years later that I found out what had really happened to her because they quickly took her from me and, and, and took her to the doctor. We had a doctor that lived on Third Street, Dr. Wendell (oh.). And they took her, ran there and took her to him. And it was much, much later that I found out, you know what had happened.

Can you describe your evolution in concept from Nia and in alignment with Karenga, too, your thinking when you got to \"Barbershop, Bibles, and BET?\" Speaker 2: So, I was in college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina] and doing all this activism, and, or what I understand to be activism, campus protests, you know, kind of campus as a laboratory, all of that is around race. We are identified, in fact, we threw campus Kwanzaa every year, we saw ourselves as bringing racial presence to the campus. I did, I did almost nothing with women's organizing on campus. Now, I took women's studies classes, I read bell hooks, but I, in my actual work I did almost nothing around womens'--unless it was black womens--work with an emphasis, probably, on the racial aspect of it. It was really in graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina] when I started to identify with two important things; one, that I was a rape survivor which, although it occurred before I ever even left to go to college, I'm really rare--I don't know that I ever really talked about it in college. I certainly hadn't even disclosed it to my own parents [William M. Harris, Sr. and Diana Gray] until senior year, maybe even, either senior year of college or first year of graduate school before I even disclosed that it had happened, even though it happened when I was fourteen. I just did not talk about it with any--when I was 14, I told one person, a friend, and no one else until I was about 20. And so, as I started engaging both my own kind of personal healing around it, started to disclose it, started to think of it as part of my identity as being a sexual assault survivor, that draws you into doing women's work in a different way and I also started reading a lot of work by African American women who were rape survivors and, of course, almost all of us are survivors of rape at the hands of men who are black, because everyone is most likely to be sexually assaulted within the context of their own race. It's not that men are most, that black men are most likely to be rapists, but they are most likely to be the rapists of black women, just as white men are most likely to be the rapists of white women. The--\"We must save the endangered black man, we must rally all together, our unity is more important than anything else\"--starts to fall apart when you are willing to be very honest about the amount of intra-racial gender violence, and it was something that even though I had experienced it, I just hadn't dealt with it or thought about it, or theorized about it, or put it in the context of my work, and once I started doing that, it forced me to say, \"Okay, how do I love the race? How do I talk about this notion of black masculinity and black manhood, but have a place to talk about what happened to me at the hands of a black man.\" And, the more that I did that and the more that I started, you know, you start just following, I try to get my students to read this way--you read one thing and that person mentions something and then you can read that person since you are kind of, you know, doing this intellectual history just through reading what the people that you're reading are reading--and when I started to\n",
      "do that, all of a sudden I realized, Oh, my God! Every time people would say, I could remember conversations in college where we would say how bad slavery was, in part because black women were raped, and if black women were raped that meant black men could not protect their women. I could remember these conversations as though the main victim of rape is the man, whose manhood is somehow damaged by this. I can remember us saying in Kwanzaa, like, \"We must protect the black woman who is our community's greatest resource.\" Ahhh--she is the community, like, push her over as the resource in part, because black sororities and fraternities come out of an era of uplift. There is also a lot of weird, like gendered stuff that goes on about being \"the backbone,\" so even though Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] is this black woman's organization, also sometimes reproduces a respectability politics that still has a relatively constrained notion for who black women are, and so you learn those things as mantras that you repeat because you're proud of the organization, and it wasn't until I start reading some of the critiques that I was like, \"Oh, yeah, woah. That is a problem.\" So it really, it was this kind of personal moment of changing my identity from, like pan-Africanist, nationalist, black girl, to pan-African nationalist black girl rape survivor, to \"Oh-wait a minute, that is going to have to change my whole analysis,\" and so by the time, and, I'm also by the way encountered Wahneema Lubiano, who made me read a whole bunch of other things and also just made me stop saying certain kinds of things and I met my very best girlfriend [Blair Kelley], who is the second half of my brain and she has never been anybody's nationalist nothing, and so she critiqued and she challenged. She is a historian, actually a dean at North Carolina State [University in Raleigh, North Carolina] right now, so, as a historian she would push back against some of the kind of ahistorical, racial things I would say and so some of it was my identity, some of it was my friendship, some of it was what I was reading, but, you know, by the time five years of graduate school passed, I had a very, very different world view. Story_ID: 564909 Speaker 1: So I want to go back, you mention that you are a rape survivor and you didn't tell your parents [William M. Harris, Sr. and Diana Gray] for a long time. Speaker 2: I don't, still never told my father. I mean, he watches the show so I guess he knows, but I never said it to my father, yeah. Speaker 1: Did your family know this person? Speaker 2: He was our neighbor, which is why I did not tell, so this was after we had moved and my mother had gone through a lot to buy the home, so this is the first time we lived in a single family home. It was the first home that she herself had purchased and bought, and the fact we built it. Not a fancy house, just very basic, but it was the home that she built. A nice little, you know, neighborhood, still two, my two best friends in high school [Thomas Dale High School in Chester, Virginia] lived in that same neighborhood. This man, his backyard, so we were a corner lot, his backyard abutted ours, and he was a father, African American man, married, was a father of two children and lived there all through my high school, (not my, he wasn't there in high school) high school years, college years. I finally told, I might be getting this timing a little wrong, I think I told junior or senior year of college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina]. I told my mom and then, and it was because she kept bugging me. Some mail for him had come to our house and she kept asking me, I was home on summer or Christmas break, and she kept asking me to take it over to him and I wouldn't and I'm not, I mean, I'm rebellious but I'm not disobedient like that and she could not under--and finally, she was like, \"Take the mail over!\" and I spilled why I wouldn't. Of course, at that point, so much time had passed no one at that point was talking and we just didn't do anything legal, but then, and this now, I'm sure I've got the timing right on this. This, the second year of graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina], and this is hard to believe but he actually hit me in the face. He was walking. In certain ways this galls me even more because, like, all right, but I was standing in my front yard, it was Christmas, I was coming home. He was walking his dog past our front yard. The dog comes into the yard to use the bathroom, which I just saw as --- and so I screamed at him to get his dog off my yard because--Jesus!-- and then he screamed back, came into the yard, we got into each other's face, and he hit me. So I called the police for that! Right? End up in court and telling the judge who this person is to me, what he had done to me, and the judge, (unclear) judge says, \"well, I mean, I don't know anything about that, if there is any report of anything like that; this just sounds like neighbors and so go home and be nice to each other.\" And, basically you know my mom's enjoyment of that neighborhood ended from the time that she knew, so she had enjoyed and loved her neighborhood, she is a gardener, she always loved to garden, but like her garden was the line of their property and so it really, so, part of the reason I never told was because sure enough, once I did and once that happened, it just made the whole experience for everyone there very, very ugly and awful, and it wasn't long after that, after the court thing happened, because even though the judge did nothing, his wife heard me say what I said and people who rape teenagers, grown men who do that, are not single-time perpetrators. It's never true, and I suspect that as the wife she also understood that he had probably perpetrated in other circumstances, whatever those were, because very shortly thereafter their marriage broke up and the family moved, but yeah, and again, I talk about being a survivor on air, but I have never had a conversation with my father about it.\n",

Not to think otherwise. It's a very vicious system and the lack of quality representation and investigation means that a lot of people really are abused by the, the system. You know, after years of doing prison and jail litigation I've talked to a lot of people under sentence of death, people who are in--serving life sentences, people who are in and out, people who have been raped, people who have had mental breakdowns, people who are dying, people who have been stabbed, people who have been beaten, people who have been put in solitary confinement, it--it's a vicious, vicious system. And I don't know how we think that those who do get out are not marked for life in ways that often make them worse than when they went in. I know we've given up as a society on rehabilitation as a goal, but the lack of education, the lack of rehabilitative services, means that the recidivism rate, which is about two-thirds will continue unabated.

Lung cancer used to be way more common in men, because only men smoked, but once women got the right [social permission] to smoke, now we're seeing more and more and more and more lung cancer among women, you know. In terms of the inmate situation, women incarcerated has typically been associated with sexual abuse of these women in early life. Now, does it mean that more women are being sexually abused? I'm not sure, exactly. Are more women being abused in general? Again, I'm not quite sure about that, but there has certainly been a surge. It used to be when I talked to a teenager about selling drugs it was always a guy; not so any more. There are more and more women; girls are out here selling drugs, okay? The social order shifts, I think, for a lot of reasons; you know, racially, socioeconomically, gender-wise, there is a lot of reason for this transition and this flow that's way beyond our discussion today.\n",

And that's really--the kids in the juvenile justice system, I'm gonna tell you a story about the juvenile justice system and the link to the child welfare system. So, a young woman--and this is a young story that's not about a particular girl but it could be about lots of girls in the child welfare system and in the juvenile justice system. So, most of the children who are physically or sexually abused are abused by some man that they know, you know, the mother's boyfriend, the uncle, the cousin, whatever. So, a, a girl is abused, sexually abused and is taken away, put into the child welfare system, put into a foster home, runs away from the foster home, wants to be home still, wants--you know, runs away from the foster home, runs away again, is put in another one, runs away again, ultimately ends up on the street. What do you think she does to keep herself alive? Speaker 2: Prostitution, yeah. Speaker 1: What she was taught, right? Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 1: So, when she's picked up for prostitution, no one ever looks back and says, how did this child really get here? What's the trauma in her life, you know? And, and she becomes one of those kids that everybody wants to look down on. Whose fault is it, you know? And so that's, to me, the number of kids that are in that situation in this country that we don't know about, we don't talk about, we don't care about is I think just outrageous.

She didn't have to live in somebody else's house. This was a big step up for her, and she sent for her daughters to come and live with her in New York [New York]. Speaker 2: That's how they came. Speaker 1: And that's how they came to New York. So in elementary school, I think, at some point. But that was very difficult. Her husband--her boyfriends, I don't know if she remarried, were physically and sexually abusive of the girls. It was not a-- Speaker 2: Your grandmother's, your grandmother's? Speaker 1: My mother [Ruby Page Schwimmer] was sexually abused by her mother's boyfriend. And they--one of the things I have again about the insights I have on this is later in life, when my mother was in her sixties, she did a lot of writing. And my mother was an English teacher. So she joined writers groups and she wrote a little vignettes, and they were stories. And they were very difficult to read. There's a story about him pounding her head on the sidewalk and bleeding, and her running away and being in a bathtub with just blood all over her. And somebody throwing things and bottles at her head, you know. It's very difficult reading. And I'm sure, much more difficult to live. She had a very difficult childhood. So even when her mother was able to send for her, and reunite the family, you know, it wasn't an easy comfortable thing. At--I think at about thirteen, she ended up moving out and becoming a mother's helper for a Jewish family. And that had a huge influence on my mother. She later converted to Judaism when I was fifteen. So the influence she\n",

I remember her crying and then finally she was able to get some help. But those kinds of stories that, that touch you that you hear. I have a lot of stories that I've heard, oh my goodness, over the years where people needed help and got it.

My father was an incredible disciplinarian, you know.

You know, they lived in apartment buildings where rats were running around. And I didn't want to spend the night because they had rats, or they had lice in the bed. So, certainly, where I lived was much better than where they were living. In terms of how other black people were living in the city, I had no clue as to where they were living or what their neighborhoods were like, because everyone I knew lived in a housing project. What I did know for sure is that, you know, I didn't like the violence. You know, I didn't like the fact that you had to protect yourself so much, and you had to be tough. And I didn't like the fact that there was so much sexual abuse and things like that, simply because, you know, people were vulnerable. I knew at an early age, I didn't like that.

A region because of this dense, thick, dense rain forest and was exploited by King Leopold [Leopold II of Belgium] in the most atrocious kind of way, you know, the kind of atrocities that he, he committed there. But out of that, you have this legacy of repression that's continues to perpetuate itself. And even now you have a war that's going on that has claimed 3 million people since 1997 and yet receives relatively little coverage. But the real victims of this war are the women and children who were pretty much helpless and who didn't start this war, who don't fight the war but find themselves bearing the brunt of it. And one of the things that I went to look at in the Congo are the kind of gender specific human rights abuses that women suffer. And what we're seeing is that rape has become one of the primary tools of war used against both men and women but because rape is a tool, a tool of war, there are certain kind of medical problems that arise, a lot of the women end up gang raped and being \"ruined,\" which is going to be the title of my play. And once they're ruined, they're driven out from their villages and they're forced to wander. So now you have this class of women who are homeless.

      "MASAKI: Yeah, I mean there's a lot of similarities and differences. I think that the differences are...Many times in trafficking cases, there's more than one victim at a time or one family at a time, and multiple survivors. For example, the police did a huge raid, which they called Operation Gilded Cage, and hundreds of trafficking survivors were a part of this case. So then that is a huge challenge. Asian Women's' Shelter, even at that time, is a sixteen-bed capacity shelter, and also sometimes it's supportive for trafficking survivors to be able to be together, but sometimes it's not. And also for the prosecution or the legal aspect, sometimes for legal reasons, the prosecution didn't want trafficking survivors to live together. So there's these kind of complicated issues that most of other survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence don't have as much. Also the difference about the crime rings. You know, very sophisticated networks of perpetrators. It's not just one isolated perpetrator that you might have in a domestic violence or a sexual assault case. I mean, sometimes it's very similar. So in some kind of trafficking, like for example, domestic workers. A lot of domestic workers are trafficked and exploited, and that might be very similar to a domestic violence case, where it's one person that was brought over to be a nanny but then really kept like a prisoner in that home. So in that way, it's very similar to the kinds of situation that, say, somebody who married into a family, where the perpetrator was abusive, her partner was abusive, and even the extended family was abusive. There's a lot of parallels there. So both. There are a lot of things that are the same, and a lot that are different. Also the legal recourse is different. What are the legal remedies that trafficking survivors can access? As well as what the legal remedies for domestic violence survivors or sexual assault survivors [are].\n",

      "So that's why I would say that a lot of the Asian-based programs for gender-based violence are also...probably if you ask all of them, and now in my new position at API Institute, I see that most all of the community-based groups are working also with trafficking survivors. Whether they advertise that or not, they are. And a lot of the trafficking survivors have the intersection of experience. They have been sexually abused, or they might be children, who grew up with incest or child sexual abuse. They might have been escaping domestic violence or sexual abuse, and then found themselves caught in a trafficking situation, or they might've been trafficked and then sexually abused or in a domestic violence situation. So the intersection of all these gender-based violences really overlaps a lot, and a lot of them ...the survivors...they will tell you the stories of their experience, but they're not going to say, Oh, I'm a sexual abuse survivor, or, Oh, I'm a domestic violence survivor, you know? Those are kind of artificial constructs, based on the law or our definitions, but survivors themselves often have the experience of the overlap of different kinds of abuse that they've experienced.\n",

      "MINGUS: It's not an organization. KWON: Oh, it's not? MINGUS: It's a collective. So it's a group of community folks who...I mean, it sounds weird to say we're all volunteers because it's our life's work, so it's not like a volunteer thing, but none of us get paid currently. We have been meeting for two years. Our goal is to create transformative justice responses to child sexual abuse, so responses that don't rely on the State, so people are able to intervene in incidences or cases of child sexual abuse without having to call the police, without having to just send somebody to prison, a response that's not just about resisting violence but also about how do we cultivate and create the world that we want, meaning the things that actually will prevent violence from happening...like safety, healing, accountability, transformation, all those things. And so that's the work that we're doing. Our vision is a Bay Area where everybody has the skills and the capacity to be able to intervene or prevent an act of or an incident of child sexual abuse. And so our work is a lot...It's very different. It's alternatives building work. It's not direct needs or immediate needs work, which tends to be a lot of responding, responding. Our work is...I feel like it's a lot slower and deeper, and so we're working towards supporting our first trial intervention in three years, we'll be doing that. Until then, what we're doing is, currently right now, we are developing a possible accountability model for TJ intervention in CSA. We've been studying accountability models and processes that have already taken place...many of which are not around child sexual abuse, just given the unique risks involved...but seeing what's transferrable and what's not, in terms of interventions that have been successful or where there's pieces of it that have been successful. And so that's one. We'll be having our first draft of that on October 1, which is so exciting. The other big piece is the provider network work that we're doing. So the framework that we're working in is...Given where we're at, and given where we want to be, obviously we want to be where it's like there's healers in every school, there's like accountability circles that are just community run that people do, and everybody knows how to run an accountability process, and you know, people don't even need to be held accountable. They take accountability, right? They do something, they're like, I want to take accountability for this, right? It's not like, You did something wrong. Ever. That's where we want to be, and we know that that's a very long way between where we are and where we want to be. So in the mean time, what is the work going to look like? Obviously, we would love to have just a pure TJ intervention that never relies on the State and is totally community based and funded, whatever, but we know that that's not...We haven't built to the scope and scale that would allow for that yet. We're still a relatively small group of people in terms of how large child sexual abuse is when we think of the statistics, which are one in four girls, and one in six boys. That's huge, right? That number. The other piece that we know is most children are abused by people that they know, that serial child sexual abusers are like less than 2%. Most people are sexually abused by people that they know or are in their intimate networks. So we have like the pervasiveness of CSA that we're like trying to work on and hopefully end it, not just respond to it, and we haven't built to the scope and scale that we want, so how do we leverage what's already here? How do we leverage what's already in place? So the provider network is going to be building a network of providers that we'e able to leverage their services in support of interventions. When we look at the landscape of child sexual abuse, we know that by far, the biggest the most significant gap is around offenders. If we think about survivors, bystanders and offenders, we know that the gap of services for offenders is huge. At least...even if they're not perfect...there's a lot more services for survivors, and there's actually some services, a lot more services for by standers, whether it's like educational groups, support groups, whatever. But when it comes to offenders, it's pretty much like you either get locked up and put in jail, there's a lot of pathologizing and therapeutic stuff, and then there's some smaller more innovative things, but that's the biggest gap, so we know that we want to work there, and then in the meantime, how do we leverage what's already existing? For survivors, how do we sort through those services and find which ones are good? Which are the best support groups? Or which of the support groups are trans* friendly? Which of the support groups are not going to tell on you or report you if you're undocumented? Which of the support groups are held in accessible spaces, right? All of those things. Who is a gynecologist that we could recommend you to or refer you to that you could actually come out as a CSA survivor and they wouldn't be an asshole to you, or that they would know and be competent around some of the impacts that that might mean for not just your medical health but your emotional health as well and have a good bedside manner around that. So in the provider network, it's people who are either aligned with transformative justice, people who are movable, like if there's just one person in the organization, for example, or somebody who's like, Yes, I know, because I'm seeing firsthand how the system doesn't work, I don't...I know we need something different, but I just don't' have enough education, or people who are just the bests in their fields. So we're having our first gathering of that at the end of this week actually, which is super exciting. The other thing that we're doing in that provider network is that we're we just had our first draft of the system maps, which are visual maps for people to be able to see what the different pathways are if you decide to engage the State, or if somebody else...like if your neighbor calls CPS [Child Protective Services] on you. So that you can literally see, Okay, if CPS comes and gets involved, here is what the process looks like. Here is the number of times you'll have to show up in court. Here are the decision makers at each step. Here's what you need to know in terms of if somebody calls 911 vs. CPS. All of that. So that feels really exciting, too, to use as like a tool to educate people but also, again, like knowing that one of the defining characteristics of living with oppression is that you have to make really hard choices, and the choices you have are not choices...I mean you already know the critique of the pro-choice movement...and they're not always just. So we're trying to also figure out how do we work with what we have, knowing that for some people because we haven't built to the scope and scale yet that...We want to be able to hold survivor healing and maybe even accountability, to be able to hold bystander education and maybe accountability and healing here, too, to be able to hold offender transformation, accountability, all of that. We can't hold all of that yet, and we want to get to a place where we can, obviously, so what does it look like in the meantime? So that's the scope of our work right now, which feels exciting. KWON: It's huge. That's a really big vision. MINGUS: Yeah, yeah, but we also think this is...and I remember coming to this realization when I was doing reproductive justice work in Atlanta...that a lot of people were not going to the clinic, not because they didn't have a state issued ID, or because they didn't have anybody to watch their kid in the middle of the day, or because they were scared that [the providers] were going to be queerphobic or transphobic. A lot of people weren't going to seek reproductive health, because they had survived sexual violence and they were like, I just don't deal with anything around any of that. I feel like I really...and so many of the people that I talked to and ended up working with had been survivors of child sexual abuse as well, and that that was just something that was a huge barrier around not only them seeking reproductive health services but also in their ability to be able to be involved in a lot of work. A lot of people were still carrying huge amounts of trauma and still had a lot of healing that they didn't [do], because they didn't have access to healing services or anything like that. Coming into the work, I started with the Atlanta Transformative Justice Collaborative, and we partnered with Generation Five, really coming into the work around a clear strategic vision around like...Given how prevalent child sexual abuse is and given how devastating the impacts are in our community...If it really is one in four girls and one in six boys, and those are just estimates, they say. They actually estimate that it's much higher than that, given that most people don't even report child sexual abuse. So if we know that it's probably higher than one in four girls and one in six boys, given the prevalence, given the lasting impacts that it's just had on one person, and then multiplying that by everyone, it's not just about impacts on relationships, which directly impact your community, because in my mind, our communities are going to be what holds our revolutions. There is no good organizer in my mind that's also not doing community building, because they're so connected. Community is like the foundation that organizing gets built upon. A lot of that's misogyny and all thatpatriarchal mess that doesn't get...community building doesn't get recognized as real work but whatever. But given that, the child sexual abuse then becomes a strategic place to do work on, that then becomes a strategic generational place to do work on, because you can literally see how not just child sexual abuse, but intimate violence as well, but particularly child sexual abuse is passed down generation to generation. So strategically going for that hitting that mark, trying to intervene the cycle around child sexual abuse, which is often times the first place where people are being taught or learning about power and control, learning about oppression. We talk about it as the building blocks of oppression, and the building blocks of what normalizes violence later on, normalizes reproductive violence, [and] normalizes all kinds of other forms of violence. That is the first place where people are learning that consent doesn't exist and that their voice does not matter, and [where people are] learning shame about their bodies...all of these themes that reproductive justice really heavily hits on and should hit on in my opinion. Child sexual abuse is also a strategic place for organizing and for all of our movements, because it's not just about this secret thing that gets hidden that happens in people's home. The state uses child sexual abuse, whether it's rape as a weapon of war...we know a lot of those rapes happen to children and young women who are not full-grown women yet, and to boys and to people who are not boys or women, who are intersex whatever. We know that the sex work and the sex trafficking that happens around the militarization, and we know the long history of Native American boarding schools and child sexual abuse being used as a tool for colonization, like all of these things. The State obviously doesn't have...if it's using child sexual abuse, it doesn't have a vested interest in ending it. So I feel like my CSA work actually is a lot about reproductive justice and I bring a lot of my reproductive justice work with me, because I just think they're just so deeply tied, and there's no way...it's impossible to separate intimate violence, and particularly sexual violence, from reproductive justice anyways. But yeah, that's the work that I do now and I feel like that's where my heart really is, because I haven't come across a community where child sexual abuse doesn't exist, and certainly within Asian women communities, people don't talk about child sexual abuse. And yet I meet so many Asian women survivors of CSA all the time, who come up to me after I've spoken somewhere or after they read about my work. They don't have anywhere to go. There's no services. Because even those larger services that we were talking about, in that survivor realm, I mean a lot of women of color don't even access those services because of the silence and the added targeting that you're putting your community at risk and your self at risk for, if you come out as a survivor. There's so many pieces to why I feel really passionate around my CSA work, and then the transformative justice piece of it, I feel is just exactly right on the money, because so many of our folks don't report it and don't' seek services because they are scared of what the state will do. They are scared of deportation, they are scare of people being harassed and beaten again or locked up and taken to prison, or because they can't call the cops cause the last time the cops came to their house, they ended up raping them. There's so many things, so it feels like a really natural progression in my mind. I hope that it makes sense in other people's minds.\n",

      "So my work is in two broad pieces. My work is disability justice, so I apply it all the time there, and then I do transformative justice work. So in that work, I feel like...The transformative justice work that I do is around community responses to child sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse is very, very pervasive, and just as the statistics that we're given say that people who are identified or assigned as girls are twice as likely to be victims of child sexual abuse, the same statistics are true around disabled children and adults, because there's also developmental stuff that gets complicated. But actually, in terms of gender, we actually think it's much more...we think it's much higher around people who get assigned as boys, too, but that there's less reporting. So it's hard to know. I feel like my TJ [transformative justice] around child sexual abuse, or CSA, work is disability justice work, because I know so many people who are survivors of child sexual abuse who are disabled people...myself included...and I know so many people who...I know that disabled communities don't talk it. No communities talk about child sexual abuse. So it's not just disabled communities, but given the prevalence, I think that it's something that disabled communities should be talking about and that most disabled children don't have access to community, don't have access...There's just so many more complications around disabled children, I feel like, that get added in around dependency and all that, so I feel like disability justice is certainly a huge piece of that work, too.\n",

I mean that's one of the things, I think a lot more shame ... a lot more stigma, a lot more mental illness, you know? Just a lot more things keeping women from being more outward when they're incarcerated. I mean, the incidence of mental illness is huge in prisons ... I mean, it's huge anyway ... but it's huge in jails. I just read this statistic that seventy-five percent of women in jails have diagnosable mental illness. That's ... that's an intense number. You know, and more than sixty percent have been victims of child abuse and sexual abuse. There's this huge correlation between injection drug use and sexual abuse.

      "So, one overtly political thing ...... and, mind you, I've always put my politics into my music. Basically, I write political songs and love songs. I don't know how to do much else, so ...... ah, every now and then I write a funny song, but Ã¢\n",
      "€Â“... so I wrote this song called \"Take Back the Night.\" And the Take Back the Night march had asked me to be one of the performers, and it was the first Take Back the Night march, so I though, Ok, well then, I need to write a song called \"Take Back the Night.\" So I wrote a song, and it starts out a capella. The lyrics go, \"Time's ain't like they was before / when night comes knockin' on my door / I'd go among the trees / to feel what's dark and heavenly. / No, time's ain't like they was before / when night come knockin' on my door.\" And then it goes, \"No man shall beat his wife on Sundays / or with a stick larger than his thumb. / Napoleonic code says women should be beaten every day like walnut trees. / Women were owned, bought\" ...... oh, I forgot the other line ...... \"Women were owned, bought, enslaved, and slaughtered. / Our feet were bound, we bound our daughters. / No more will we deny / no more will we be in conspiracy\" ...... and there's a lot more lyrics to it, that I don't remember all, but then it goes, \"We've got to say that it is men who violate\" ...... terrorize and violate, or something like that. \"We've got to say, we've go to say it's men. / Men abuse us, terrify us, drowned us at birth, burn us alive, rape and beat us, and they keep us, yeah, they keep us terrorized. / Can you remember ever feeling safe? / Do you remember only feeling scared? / Yes, we've got to, yes, we've got to / take back the night.\" And then, towards the end, it says, \"It may not be all men, but you can bet, / it's always men who own the night. / When you go home tonight, / some man may try to take your life / and you'll have to fight.\" And it repeats the chorus. So, when I was in the Toshi Reagan band ...... Toshi Reagan and the Agitones ...... we did my songs and Toshi's songs, and we did covers, and I presented this song as one that I would like us to do, and one of the band members refused to play it. And I will say this, Toshi did stick up for the song, and it wasn't Toshi. Toshi did stick up for the song. The other band member said that she didn't want to offend men, and she thought that the song would offend men. And I said, \"Well, ok, these are the men that rape and beat us, torture us, drown us alive, burn us. I don't care about offending them,\" you know. \"Well, all men don't do that.\" I said, \"And so, at the end of the song, I say, \"˜it may not be all men, but you can bet it's always men who own the night.' I've taken care of those guys who might get their feelings hurt, alright?\" And she's like, \"I won't do it,\" you know. And Toshi was apologetic, she says, \"You know, I can't force her to do the song.\"\n",

      "ACEY: I'm trying to think. I think that I was a senior and she was a junior. I think I mentioned, my sister and I have lived in the same city, in very close proximity, for all of our lives, except for about two years when she was in graduate school out in Texas and Arizona. Rosary Hill was, as I said, in the suburbs, and there was no transportation. The buses ran, but they stopped at a certain hour. Buses didn't even run, I don't think, on the weekends. So the college culture in Buffalo ... not just at Rosary Hill, and probably in the United States, I would imagine ... was you hitchhiked. I remember hitchhiking from Buffalo to Albany to go see somebody. You know, we were hitchhiking together. My first years, before I moved off campus, I had a job off campus, and I would hitchhike to that job, and once a guy exposed himself. I used to carry a knife actually, but I don't know what I thought I was going to do with it. ANDERSON: But you still didn't think you were gay? (laughter) ACEY: It had a nice little leather holder. ANDERSON: Yes, I was going to say. ACEY: I forgot about that too. God, you know, the things that come back to you are amazing. So it was a culture of hitchhiking, and people were careful. I eventually stopped hitchhiking by myself. I didn't think it was such a cool, you know ... But sometimes you just got desperate though, you had to get someplace. Nobody had the money to have cabs, and it wasn't like New York where you just, you know, put your hand out. My sister and her roommate were going out for the evening to a bar, and they left campus and they hitchhiked. They got picked up by two guys, who drove them near where they were going, but pulled into the driveway at the state hospital, which is this big ... massive acres and trees and deserted and dark ... you know, long driveway. My sister and her roommate were in the back seat of a two-door car, and when they went to let them out, her roommate got out, they pushed her, and they drove off. Her roommate got hysterical and called the police when she got somewhere ... I can't remember ... and got some help. I worked my way through college. I mean, I had some scholarships and my parents helped me, but I always held down a job. I don't know how I did that. I used to take a lot of classes, be involved in politics, and work. I just don't know how that all happened but it did. I was probably a crazy person then too. ANDERSON: Yeah, it was the pace that you set a long time ago that you still have. ACEY: I was running the student union that night and there was a dance. I got a call to come to the police station. I was with these close women friends, and I didn't have a jacket, it was chilly. My friend gave me her leather jacket and said, \"Wear this.\" And I went off, and I got to the police station and found out what had happened to my sister. She'd been beaten and raped. She'd been found in a park. There was an alert out, that she was in a park that was closed, with these guys, and the police were just doing a routine run-by of the park, and they saw this car and they investigated. So my sister was traumatized. There was a woman police officer talking to her and then to me. The guys who had done this were African American, and the police were saying some really outrageous ... So it was this, really, another one of those conflict-ridden, contradictory situations where both she, who is, like, bruised and beaten ... She was a virgin. She might have been a sophomore or a freshman. I don't know, (inaudible) personal history, anyway. So we got into an argument with the police officer, who had begun to make some racist statements, and I made the comment that, \"How can you say this? I was with friends, this jacket belongs to my friend.\" So I just said to them, \"Let's just leave this, let's just get out,\" because she had to get to the hospital, get all these tests. We're talking late '60s, maybe 1970s. I can't remember if I was of legal age, because I am a year older, but we basically didn't want my parents to know what happened to my sister, because we felt it would kill them, knowing that she'd been raped and brutally beaten. To this day we don't know. There were all kinds of knives and axes in the car, so we don't know if they intended to kill ... ANDERSON: So you were trying to protect your parents from the pain of that. ACEY: We were trying to protect my parents, which was, you know, probably the very wrong thing to do. And then within days, my mother and my aunt were coming to visit, and now this became a big thing. There was a big newspaper article that someone had been raped from campus. Nobody knew, so there was all this buzz on the campus. My sister is not in a great shape, we're trying to keep this from our parents. My aunt and mother arrive, and we go out and do something and we come back to my sister's room, and she's on the phone sobbing. What the police had done is to call my father and told him that his daughter was brutally beaten and raped, and his other daughter ... they made up some kind of story, and I can't remember. Again, I'd have to ask my sister exactly how it went, but they got in that his other daughter ... they got in the leather jacket and all that, but they kind of made it something else. ANDERSON: And African American friends too. ACEY: Yeah, they kind of made it an ugly story rather than how it was. So then here we are, my mother and Anna want to know what's happened and why was my sister crying. So that was like completely ... And Joanne, well, she had to go through three trials. She already had left Buffalo and gone off to graduate school, and they were flying her back. I think the first trial was a hung jury, and the second trial they were convicted, but then they got off on a technicality, an appeal. And then there was a third trial, at which they were, in fact, convicted. One, I think, ended up serving a few months, the other a year. So, ah, it was, you know, a big thing. I think I went through a lot of denial, you know? ANDERSON: Yeah. ACEY: A number of years later, I began to be more in touch with the feelings about it. Now I ... you know, fast forward ... I have become involved in the women's movement, through reproductive rights and sterilization abuse work, and then anti-sterilization abuse, and also antiviolence, women's antiviolence work, mostly around sexual assault and rape, but also somewhat around battered women. They were different organizations at that time, but the women who were doing the antiviolence work were very connected. Some are involved in both. So it was years later that I got more connected to what had happened, because I think I went into a very ... denial: [it] happened, [it's] over. You know, I felt like my sister needed to get some help. Initially she did a little counseling, but she really never, I don't feel ... The resources weren't there. She was treated terribly by the defense attorneys, treated terribly by the medical folks. There was no one place that I feel she got what she needed, and I think even from me. My parents were devastated, but again, there wasn't a lot of discussion about it. So years later I got more in touch with what had happened, kind\n",
      "of the hugeness of it. ANDERSON: Through the movement or through other personal work or therapy? ACEY: In working within the women's antiviolence movement. By the time I got involved with it, there were many lesbians, women of color. It was about organizing and advocacy but also services, but it was also about personal. So the more exposed I got to people working, but also women who had experienced some violence, the closer it got me to, like, begin to get better in touch and to begin to take in that experience in a whole different way. I remember distinctly one conference where there was a session that was women of color only, to talk personally. The opening question was, We're going to go around the room, and I want each person to ... if they can ... relate an experience of their own or of someone close to them or one they know. I remember there might have been about 40 women in the room. Every single woman had a story, and I was totally overwhelmed by it. Again, this is years later. We're maybe talking at least ten years later, if not more ... probably more ... since my sister's rape. I just remember just sobbing and sobbing, and then I started to talk a little more to my sister. Well, now we're talking, you know, well over 30 years ago. It still feels like it didn't get completely processed, if you will, so. \n",

      "So it was in New York that I really came into feminism. At first I got involved in CARASA [Coalition for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse], and then I got involved with New York Women Against Rape. You know, besides the student politics, there was a group of us that started a journal called Catalyst: A Socialist Journal of the Social Services. And I think we changed it to the Human Services. So that was one piece of work. I did a lot of other pieces of organizing, kind of in and out ... Farm workers. Later on ... I was already out of school ... but anti-apartheid. I kind of was touching down in different places. Kind of Catalyst was an anchor of doing some work. I did a lot of different study groups ... feminist study groups, political economy. I loved the study group thing because you kind of, like, read and talk to people, sharpen ... ANDERSON: Did you do more study groups than c.r. [consciousness-raising] groups? ACEY: There were more study groups than c.r. groups, but I did some c.r. groups with different groupings of people. So a couple of c.r. groups, and then there was one c.r. group which was kind of a c.r. group but really, we read, we socialized, we did c.r. It kind of was more of a blend, and that pretty much ... you know, into the '70s and right into the '80s, quite a bit of that. Some of my groups were really small, not the political economy. One group ... there was five of us, and we worked with a mentor to really read all of Marx. Another group was a feminist. We looked at the movement, we read articles, books, had discussions, potlucks. Another group was more like a feminist support group, and was the political kind. So there was always at least one going on, if not two, for a number of years, and they kind of stretched out. Then I got very involved in New York Women Against Rape.\n",

It was full of imagination and games and the kind of intrigue and fun you have when-when you imagine and you go to the movies on Saturday and you ... you know, you sit with all the kids and you get in trouble with the matron. I mean, these are just wonderful memories that I have. Um, there was a darkness in my life. I was sexually abused by a relative, um, when I was very young, and I've never mentioned it to my family. My family knows nothing at all about it. And that ... I think that does things to a child that somehow takes the wonder off things, that it tarnishes trust in a way that ... that you can still smile and run around and have a good time and fun but there's just a little bit something that happens and it's not good. It's ... whether it's guilt or because I think you always feel like somehow responsible even though you're 9 or 10 years old and this is an adult, um, but it's a very tragic thing, and it's ... although I don't believe in the death penalty, it's left me so angry that I would never be willing to sit on a jury in a sex abuse case because I know I couldn't be reasonable about it. I couldn't weigh with any measure because of my own feelings. ANDERSON: Did this go on into high school? APUZZO: No, it went - well, it went on into like, the eighth grade, about. ANDERSON: And then did you sort of block it out, compartmentalize it? APUZZO: I compartmentalized ... yeah, I just compartmentalized it but, you know, being Catholic, you know, being Catholic and having sex be such, you know, an overwhelming issue and inordinately, inordinately demonized by the church, when something like that is your first sexual experience, you just, um, you always carry it. You always feel that there's a burden of guilt on you, somehow you did it. You were responsible. It was your fault. At any rate ... ANDERSON: Did you get help from any adult at that time? APUZZO: No. I've never gotten ... I've never ... ANDERSON: Not ... no teachers, no one? APUZZO: No. No. Um, but I entered high school, and uh, was delighted to be there, had a great time. You know, a lot of us who went to Catholic school who were lesbian have crushes on teachers. I had the experience where the teachers had crushes on me. And it was overwhelming in not a good way. ANDERSON: How did they display their affection towards you? APUZZO: One nun kept a diary that she would give to me periodically. And um, it just ... it wasn't abuse in the way that we're experiencing the church today but it was ... it was emotionally imposing. It was...I was 13 years old. Um, to have all that attention, to be kept after school, to just ... for someone else's enjoyment. I mean, I got off on it. It was not like the world's worst thing, but again, there is a burden of an adult imposing their emotional needs on a youngster. This is just ... it's a theme in my life. ANDERSON: Did they do this to any other young woman that you knew of? APUZZO: Oh, yeah, you know. The nuns ... mostly the girls had crushes on the nuns, you know, and you knew the girls who had crushes on the nuns and it was, you know, it's like, very girl, blah-blah.

      "ASETOYER: Well, that's very heavy on your shoulders. It's always there. We have to look at what our families went through in that colonization process. We have to look at what our mothers and our fathers went through, what our grandparents went through, what our great-grandparents went through ... and prior to that, before a reservation, all the wars, all the violence, and the famine and the relocation. You know, we have to look at all of those things and how that impacts our community and our lives today. In boarding schools, there was a horrendous amount of corporal punishment that took place, as well as sexual abuse. Our mothers, our fathers, were raped, were sodomized, were violated by the priests within the Catholic Church. And prior to contact with boarding school experience, sexual abuse was unheard of on children. It was unheard of in our culture ... not to say that it did not exist, but from all the questions and research that we have done and all the interviews, that on the very rare occasion when something like that would surface, it was dealt with harshly. Abandonment, you know ... you were abandoned by the tribe. You were set outside the camp to survive on your own and that's it. You were disappeared. It was dealt with very harshly. The impact and the volume of sexual assault that occurred and sexual abuse that occurred in the boarding schools, you know, the rapes and the molestations, have had a horrendous impact on our culture. And the appropriate resources have not been provided for us to deal with it appropriately by the Indian Health Service or Health and Human Services. So, what we're doing is, we're, in our communities, starting the healing process, the dialogue, because of the impact, generation after generation, that this has had on our people. And it's very important to start that process of dialogue, to start the process of ceremony, to start the process of healing and to engage in that, because Indian Health Service, for the magnitude of the problem, is virtually doing nothing. And that, to me, is a continuation by omission, by omitting their responsibility, of the colonization process and the genocide and the ethnocide. And so, they're very guilty of that.\n",

And I remember we were going to have it in a classroom and the place was packed, and they tried to close the door and people were taking the door off the hinges. So next, Lillie moved it up to the big area, outside area, in the big hallway, in the walk path. So it was huge. And it was really there that I think we really started to understand that we are the ones we were waiting for, like June Jordan said, and that the answers are in our stories, and it's in the process of telling our stories that can set us free and put us on the right path. So it was such a gift, and it was such a wonderful way to learn about our health issues, to learn about how much violence that we were living with ... be it domestic violence, be it sexual violence ... to know that so many women have been raped, that so many women have been victims of sexual abuse, and have had no way to talk about it, to heal, and how when women do it in isolation or when it's done to us in isolation, we think that we're the only people having it happen, that nobody else in the world is having it happen. But what we learn in the presence of other black women, that this is happening, we understand that we have an institution of sexism that's going on in our lives that tends to oppress us, and that the only way we can get out from under it is to learn how to unhook. And that was the gift that Lillie brought to the black women's health movement, is how do we unhook, and the value of storytelling.\n",

We taught them Self-Help, we talked about our issues, we focused in three areas. These were the areas that were identified by the women in South Africa, and each of us ... there were five of us ... and each of us were paired with a South African woman.

      "I think that, though, one thing that I must say that stands out crystal clear to me was probably the most important thing I did was ask the question, What's the difference between black women's health issues and white women's health issues? Mostly because that placed an emphasis on looking at us based on our ethnicity, our culture, our subculture, the way we were reared, the things that go on in our life and how that affects our health, and the fact that we as black women have a different perspective. I was really perplexed by, when white women got together, really the most of the things they only wanted to talk about were reproductive health issues. But when black women got together, and we started talking about health, we started talking about different things. We started talking about things that had to do with psychological well-being. We started talking about issues that were affecting our lives ... violence, sexual abuse ... and also, white women were talking about these things, but they were not priorities. And reproductive health ... black women would use reproductive health services but they were not priorities. And so, the whole thing that makes our health issues unique to us depends on looking at what are our specific priorities that have been influenced by who we are and our ethnicities.\n",

And more than anything else, I think that if black people are suffering today from the rulings of Clarence Thomas ... and they are ... a lot of it has to do with their refusal to take up Anita Hill's exposure of him as a sexual abuser. And had they taken that a little bit more seriously, they would recognize that black faces in high places is not something that's going to resolve the problems that black women are facing today, nor that other people of color are facing today. So I think that was a lesson for some people. Then again, it had an impact on a number of people feeling there needed to be a more progressive black voice in the country\n",

And what happened was that this woman, who was an English major and studied poetry, didn't write poetry, I believe now, although I can't say for sure, probably was a survivor of incest, or priest abuse. One or the other, I'm not sure. But something about whatever that was and our sex life and being in the closet or whatever, so she attempted suicide. Or maybe it was just because she was studying Yeats. I don't know. And had to go into the infirmary at Mount Holyoke. And I was so upset, that I asked to be allowed to be in the infirmary with her and they said, Sure. So she was there, and she couldn't leave, but I would go out to classes and I would come back and I was, like, living in the infirmary with my lover.\n",

How much trauma are we already surviving as women based on some of the other social injustices that happen to us? Rape, incest, child molestation, just neglect, being treated differently because of skin color in the family. I mean, all of these are critical issues for women of color that play into not only the decisions we make in terms of HIV but what might happen or us or what might not be available to us because of all of those other conditions. Those are the intersections where HIV and reproductive justice and human rights really come alive in the work that we do at SisterLove.\n",

At the same time, you know, a lot of my adult work in recent years has been about preventing child sexual abuse, so I went through that whole period of time in my teenage years from the age of 12 to 16, when my father, you know, sexually abused me.

That's part of what has made me care about prevention, and to want to do whatever we can to pay attention to prevention so that these kinds of families aren't torn apart by a sexual abuse thing happening, which is what would happen in today's world if that happened to me and I'd told about it. \n",

      "But there was a real, a real understanding that things left unseen, and unstated, and untold, the secrets of grief, shape history. And that if people could come forward and say what had happened to them, and confront the people who had hurt them, speak directly to them, it was a different... that was reconciliation. Not because those people could ever compensate them, but because they could face the people who had hurt them, and say that it was unjust. And I've always thought that political movements should spend more time thinking about frameworks that actually allowed us to both confront and reconcile grief with oppression. Especially in terms of class, in terms of things like sexism and violence, because the men that perpetuate, or the women that perpetuate either of those things, but mostly men, are also men you love. And so if we could find a way in our own movements, to both hold people accountable and still love them, I think we would build a different kind of movement, that could confront real powerlessness and real oppression differently, because we would not say to people that they had to choose not to love those people any longer in order to hold them to a standard of behavior that they did not match. And, you know, it's not a conversation we talk about. And yet, when I look at things like violence and incest and substance abuse and all of that kind of stuff, reconciliation and truth are precisely what you actually need to do, in order to be able to live with. How oppression turns you into an animal! I mean, give me a fucking break! Being poor, being hungry, being addicted, being violated yourself, being disrespected and hated, doesn't turn you into a nice person. And if we're ever going to, in the women's movement, come to terms with the way that we are hurt, and we hurt each other, it will be because we can actually have a different kind of dialogue that doesn't assume that I'll sue you or I'll imprison you. \n",

      "PAYNE: In 1982, I started to feel better. I know exactly when it was. In 1982, I started to feel better ... November of '82. I woke up in Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, and it was like there had been static in my brain, and I sometimes think ... I don't talk about this too much anymore ... I sometimes think that I had the world's worst case of PMS, because I was sick all the time from it. And it was before there was a lot of, you know ... like everything happened before there was a lot of focus on it. And between not knowing what to tell the doctor ... and nobody ever connected diseased ovaries and other things with what might be happening to me mentally and psychologically. And certainly nobody talked very much in the '50s and '60s about self-esteem and, you know, women's issues. There was very little focus on the particular role that black women had in the civil rights movement. There was just not sensitivity to the things that could cause illness. And because I was an intelligent person, I really served as a guinea pig for doctors. I was going to Washington University's mental health clinic. And I can't remember how many times they had me as the focus for discussion for interns. Because I could articulate what I was feeling, you know, I really think I served as a guinea pig and that they tried different medications. One doctor, after a long time, even suggested that I smoke marijuana instead of taking the medications, because, well, they were giving folks LSD, marijuana, everything, man. But a young, intelligent, undereducated, underemployed, physically and sexually abused, unmarried woman with a small child living in poverty ... you'd have been crazy as hell not to be depressed. (laughs) Me. And nobody ever looked at any of those things. They just said, We'll have to increase that medicine. Nobody ever talked to me about diet, exercise, anything that I could do except take medication, you know. And it wasn't just me. There were lots and lots of people lost in the medical system that just ... nobody ever talked to me about food supplements, you know, nothing. Nothing, nothing. Just take the medication. Just take the medication. And when I see what I saw over the years was, I saw so many women, not just get sick, but die. And I had lupus. And not just get sick, but die. I buried my friends ... from strokes, from heart attacks, from lupus, from high blood pressure, you know. It wasn't just about people being sick. The people died ... from battering, from domestic violence, from drug abuse, from poor decisions, you know. People died. People died. The women died. And we didn't know what was killing us. And we didn't have any place to talk together. Church wasn't helpful, because at church, they talk to you, you don't get to talk, you know. It's helpful because you learn some stuff, I guess, if you go or whatever, but the people didn't have an opportunity to express themselves. So, in our circles, I think because I wasn't ashamed of what had happened to me, I could talk about things like being sexually molested, being a victim of domestic violence, without feeling that it had been my fault. I didn't think it was my fault. I didn't think it was my fault. I know whose fault it was, but I didn't think it was my fault. And I think, because I began speaking about these things, women started to come to me, individually and in small groups, and they wanted to talk about what happened to them, too. So, the beginning of this work is what we used to call Community Conversations, where we would just have something to eat, a cup of tea, a cup of coffee, and just talk about what was going on and what did it mean.\n",

And I began to teach that, to not be a victim. Not be a victim. Not be a victim. To rise up, you know. And it was revolutionary for me, but also for a lot of the women that I work with, because a lot of the women thought that because these things had happened to them, therefore they were always going to be a victim of domestic violence, sexual abuse ... that their primary identity was around that victim status.\n",

So the health departments not only have called us other and don't call us Asian and Pacific Islander ... Native Americans and Asians have been put together as a group called other, so a lot of data is put as other and we don't ... you can't write a proposal and say, Our data is based on other. So we have the problem of people not understanding that specific AIDS education has to be in the specific language, but that also the customs are very critical. And you have to respect not only the traditions and customs, but you have to respect what has happened, for example, during the war ... and I say the war meaning World War II, but it could be Vietnam, it could be, you know, what went on in Korea. In a war situation, just like Abu Ghraib and different things that have happened with American soldiers terrorizing and raping and doing things that soldiers feel they have a right to do when they're in another country. It's a man thinking that he has the right to rape a woman of another language. That happened in World War II. In the case of World War II, very often it was the Japanese soldiers going to China or the Philippines, and so you have people there who hate the Japanese, rightfully so, because of what they perceive to be such a dehumanizing situation. Those same people ... if, for example, I spoke Japanese or spoke English with a Japanese accent, and I went into a group and tried to give them AIDS 101, they would be thinking to themselves, What is that Japanese woman ... look what the Japanese did during World War II. What is she talking to us about sex for? The lesson would be lost. They would be reliving World War II. And it's just like, I'm sure, some Iraqis will be reliving what's going on now. And even though we deny that things happen, we deny that we ... we do do things during war, and it's a man-woman thing, it's a conqueror mentality.

It happened that we also owed that publisher a lot of money, because we had used my book as a subscription premium and then not had the money to fully pay for those copies. So in order to pay the debt, and also because, like many women, I think, I had always had a kind of rescue fantasy about Marilyn Monroe, in the sense that, had there been a women's movement, would she still be alive? So many things about her were like exaggerated versions of many women's experiences: being sexually abused as a child; being abandoned by her mom ... a single mom; abandoned first by her father; and certainly being treated as an object more than a person in many ways, especially before she became famous, but even afterward. So if she had felt less alone in those experiences, would she have been able to survive? So I was also fascinated, but if it hadn't been for paying the debt and the photographs, I probably wouldn't have done it.

      "1974 that I began working at the Rape Crisis Center. And at first, I was just sort of doing all kinds of things, you know, doing a little hotline stuff, a little community education stuff. It wasn't all ... and really, I think they were sort of preparing me for Nancy's job, the general administrator, because she was going to leave, and after she left, I became general administrator. ROSS: OK. What was going on in your thinking about black women and the women's movement at the time? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh, child, a lot of things. First of all, I mean, I was very passionate about the issue of rape and sexual assault and women being helped. I was very disturbed by what seemed to me to be the lack of a presence of black women and women of color in the movement. But certainly many of our clients were black women. So what was going on in my mind was one, how to serve women and two, how to get more women of color involved in the Rape Crisis Center and get the Rape Crisis Center more connected with the community, beyond what it was. It was also, initially, in the beginning, it was a learning time for me, you know, to learn exactly what is feminism. You know, how do people define feminism? What is the scope of feminism under that definition? Learning more about pornography, because I'd never really thought about pornography ... you know, nasty men read pornography at night when nobody's looking, or something. I mean, in terms of thinking of it as an industry that disempowered women or, you know, devalued or objectified, all of that. Those were not really words in my vocabulary or concepts, you know. So my first months at the Rape Crisis Center, first year, was a learning process for me, too. Learning more about feminist thinking and what the issues and the politics of it was. And always trying to see how it fit and integrated in my community, because I certainly saw the urge to try to make people split and choose. If you're black, you can't be a feminist. If you're a feminist, you're not black. If you're for the women's struggle, then you can't be for the people's struggle. If you're for the people's struggle, then how can you isolate out just the women. All that craziness, you know, just trying to navigate my way through it, figure out what the heck was going on. ROSS: Name some of the black feminists who may have influenced your thinking, you may have encountered in the mid-70s. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh. I mean, certainly people who I was reading, that came more toward, I guess ... I'm trying to think. When did I first read something from bell hooks and something from Audre Lorde? I don't think that I knew a lot of black women, because I hadn't really ... in the rape crisis movement at that time, hadn't really come across, you know, hardly any other black women. I mean, I knew about New York Women Against Rape and so I knew some of them had to be something, somebody had to be black or Puerto Rican or something like that. But I didn't really know a whole lot about who the women were. Of course, I mean, I heard of like the star feminists at the time, you know, Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan and, um, Bella Abzug and Flo Kennedy, you know, I'd heard of, but I didn't really know a lot about that. ROSS: So at the time, we're talking about '74, '75, '76, what was the Rape Crisis Center doing vis-Ãƒ -vis black women in terms of outreach to or work with or ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: Talking about it. Even though they always made a concerted effort to bring black women onto the staff, they really felt that going into the schools or education should be a black woman, because that's mainly who was going to be in those schools, that that was in the staff, there should be black women. There was really a problem recruiting. There seemed to be a problem to recruit black people onto the board of directors, you know, who came or who actually stayed. So for the most part, most of the time, for a really long time, the board was always ... basically, it was white, as was, now, in '76, when we went with CETA and VISTA, you know, and CETA was the concentrated employment program [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act], so that brought us quite a few women of color, and then VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America, that brought us ... so that was the time when we had the largest women-of-color staff. We had Latino women, because we wanted to do work in Addams, which was a predominantly Latino community, to assess the attitudes about rape and what kind of services and what people did there, and the same in the black community. So, we had, like, three or four Latino sisters and about six black women that came on specifically through CETA and VISTA. I think the main way that the Rape Crisis Center at the time was reaching the black community was through the services provided for clients. They were just always aware that they were very lacking and very short in terms of the relationships and the networks et cetera to be a crisis center in the District of Columbia. \n",

That's very, very helpful, because I know it was definitely, it was pre- the Rape Crisis Center, but it was right after the Rape Crisis Center that, when you came to the Rape Crisis Center, right around that time, that you proposed me for the Study Group. ROSS: Right. So it's all kind of ... our stories are rather interconnected from then on, but, I'd be fascinated to hear the pre-1978 story of Nkenge. In terms of, well, you stayed at the Rape Crisis Center for 13 years until 1988. In that time you had a variety of jobs. Tell me about some of the more significant things that you did at the Rape Crisis Center. You certainly pioneered quite a bit. TOURÃƒÂ‰: I did do a lot of things at the Rape Crisis Center, speaking with all humility and truth. Once I came back, I became the director for community education. That's the job that I held. That's the position that I held until I left. I brought Anti-Rape Week into the Rape Crisis Center, something I'm really proud of, because it exists today under a different name, but ... ROSS: What was Anti-Rape Week? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Anti-Rape Week was a massive education week where there were all kinds of workshops, seminars, film showings organized, and we advertised and people would come out to events. So it was to build education to raise prevention awareness, and to recruit people into an awareness of, and hopefully support for, the Crisis Center and to take a look at and become advocates for the issue of sexual assault, rape. So we did Anti-Rape Week, and then the women who were a part of FAAR, Feminists Against Pornography, if that was the right name, organized. The Rape Crisis Center had actually worked and organized the first Take Back the Night march in D.C., which I think was in 1978. I think it was in 1978. And then, the following year, I organized Anti-Rape Week. I don't think we had a march that year. Then the following year is like when Feminists Against Pornography picked up and decided that that was going to be one of their major things that they would do every year was organize a Take Back The Night march and the Crisis Center would work with them, so we coordinated so that the Take Back the Night march became a part of Anti-Rape Week, either the beginning or the end, you know, a major activity. [As a member of Feminists Against Pornography, Marty Langlen, a white woman, was central to this organizing effort. She also became a member of the Rape Crisis Center board of directors. Another woman with Feminists Against Pornography who did a lot of work was Clarisse.] And Anti-Rape Week evolved into Rape Awareness Week, and then as the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault took up rape awareness, and ultimately had Rape Awareness Month, which the rape crisis centers across the country pretty much observed and organized for that in their communities. The hassle-free zone. There was a lot of street harassment going on in D.C. There was a sister named Linda Leaks, not was, she is, who was in school at the time and she was making a film on street harassment, and she was so impassioned about it ... ROSS: She is a black woman. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Linda Leaks is a black woman who was making a film on sexual harass[ment] ... street harassment, and Linda was so impassioned about it that she also created a t-shirt to stop violence against women, you know, verbal abuse of women. Well, at the time that she was doing that, dealing with the street harassment and kind of strategizing around how to combat it and how to respond to it, white women were also doing some organizing and they had come to the idea that they wanted to make Dupont Circle ... in D.C., Dupont Circle was, is an area that is sort of a hub area for the commercial district downtown and people come there and they eat lunch and walk through, and then, it's part of the social life at night. So there's a lot going on in Dupont Circle and around Dupont Circle. So you can get harassed walking through there or sitting in there and trying to eat your lunch, and all of that. So a group of white women had decided they wanted to be able to not be hassled in Dupont Circle, so they wanted that to be, you know ... My idea was that they could not take Dupont Circle and single out Dupont Circle as a place not to be harassed, that if we were going to try to have a campaign, we needed to wage a campaign to make D.C. a hassle-free zone. So that you would have the right, wherever you were, not to be \"Hey, baby, hey, mama,\" all of that kind of nonsense ... \"What's your sign? What's your name?\" ... all of that, that you wouldn't have to deal with it. So, we [joined forces and] entered on a real struggle to make D.C. a hassle-free zone. We met with the police, you know, because we wanted to have penalties. We wanted to have it written in law somewhere, you know, penalties around this whole thing. And we worked on it for about two years, but we just couldn't really make it happen. It was too big. But in the process, there was a lot of education. We used to have what were called speak-outs, and we'd just be different places, at a Metro stop on a Friday, in Dupont Circle on a Wednesday, maybe down at the Federal Triangle on a Monday, Easter Market, various places, to do rallies, where people would speak out about street harassment, sexual harassment on the streets, and we would make the interconnections between street harassment and pornography and rape, you know. And we did a lot of consciousness-raising and a lot of great organizing as a result of that in those two years that we worked on that. Also, doing the organizing of the Take Back the Night marches and the Anti-Rape Weeks that we did for a number of years, that is one of the ways that I was able to bring a lot of women of color into the Rape Crisis Center, that came to work and organize around these different issues for Anti-Rape Week. More women of color than the Rape Crisis Center had ever seen collectively in all the years prior to that. Women came in and it was a very exciting process. They volunteered to be on the hotlines and as a result ... and that was all, that was really good stuff. ROSS: Describe, if you don't mind me backing up just a little bit, what was going on that caused the 1980 conference to happen, or am I going too far? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, no. You're speaking about the first conference on Third World Women and Violence. It came about because there was that need to pull women of color together, to acknowledge that violence existed in our communities, to talk about the forms that it took, the kinds of responses that we got to it, the attitudes that existed there, and what needed to be done. It also came about because women of color who were doing this work desperately needed to know each other. We needed to network. We needed to build and consolidate a network. And so, though that conference brought about 80 women, you know, in total, however, they came from a lot of different places, and we were able to find out about, like Fatima Cortez, with that little rape crisis center up there in New Bedford or someplace in Massachusetts. We had the New York Women Against Rape come down, that's when we had the great honor to meet and develop our first relationship with Sandra Comacho, Ch\n",
      "rrÃƒÂ­e Moraga, and those women from New York. The women from Boston came, and so we first met ... not Barbara ... I'm trying to remember ... Barbara Bullette was there. It was the woman who was the therapist, Ruth something [Ruth Hall]. But a few women came from Boston. We all ... that was the start of the building and continuation of a network. Those were the first steps towards that. So that was really, that was really a great, a great conference. And it was really exciting. It was part of ... we made it a part of Anti-Rape Week and it was great, and it was where we got ... I believe it's where we got our famous logo. ROSS: Tell me about that logo. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Our famous logo which represented ... the Rape Crisis Center had this beautiful logo that ironically, it was done for us by a brother named Malik Edwards, who used to be one of the artists for the Black Panther Party, who drew the pictures for the Panther Speaks newspaper, and we asked Malik if he would develop ... wait, let me back up for one second. I'm running two thoughts together. I'm running this thought ... no, I know what it is. The Shanti Dolls. I was getting ready to run it in with ICAW [International Council of African Women] and the Dolls that Beverly did for us. OK. Put that on the side. Malik, who had been in the Black Panther Party, we asked him if he would develop a logo for us for our conference, the Third World Women and Violence Conference, and he drew for us ... he came back with four fertility dolls, one looking Asian, one African born in America, one First Nation, and one Latina, and it was the details on the fertility dolls that determined the ethnicity of each of them. And so these four together represented women of color, and made an extremely powerful statement. So it became the logo for the Third World Women and Violence conference. And then our very next edition of the Rape Crisis Center publication that dealt with myths and facts about rape, we used that logo on it. And it was just ... what can I say? It was a success. Anyone whoever looked at it loved it. Of course, there did come a time, somewhere down the road, where there was conflict when someone said, \"There's no white doll, you know, there's only four, there should be five dolls.\" Why? \"There's no white woman.\" Well, the logo didn't change. It didn't expand, you know, under the creator's vision. That was his vision of what we had asked him to do for that conference, so that was that. So that is how the Third World Women and Violence ... it's called the First National, because it actually was the First National Conference on Third World Women and Violence, and we were honored to be the people to put out the call for that.

And then, the detail of it really didn't come back to me until I wrote an essay called \"Spirit and Passion,\" where I described the incident. And as I was writing it, I just ... I really remembered all the details, my uncle in the night and the lamp and the whole ... and so, she was dead by then. My grandma died, I don't know how many years ago. And so I never ... no. ANDERSON: So, do you think that next morning you were still thinking about it, and just didn't say anything to your grandmother about it? Or do you think that you'd already, by the next morning, sort of blocked it out.? Do you remember being around her and being afraid for her and upset about what you had witnessed? Or do you think you just really shoved it away immediately? VAZQUEZ: No, no, I think I did. I think I did. I mean, I remember my uncle that night, because I was crying and upset, my uncle holding me and taking care of me and telling me it was going to be all right. My uncle was maybe ten years older than me, ten or 12 years older than me, so he was, you know, a child himself, just a young teenager, and he had probably witnessed stuff like that before. So, that's my uncle Hernan, who also never married ... number of bachelors in that family. I wonder what that was about. Anyway ... ANDERSON: It must have been a terrifying night for you. VAZQUEZ: It was a terrifying night. ANDERSON: Because the woman that is your protector, is your parent at that time, is being hurt. VAZQUEZ: Yeah. ANDERSON: Did you ever feel afraid in that house? Did that translate to him, to you feeling afraid of your grandfather? Was he ever mean or abusive to the kids? VAZQUEZ: Yeah, because I think before that, we just sort of didn't have much to do with him. We'd avoid him. He was, you know, the gruff guy, whatever. And after that, I was afraid of him. Forever. For the rest of my life. And actually, he ... there was an incident later in New York where he actually exposed himself to myself and my cousin Evie and, you know, we were, like, six years old or something like that. I mean, he didn't do anything, but that's terrible enough. But it was, you know, I really hated the man.\n",

      "We were perfectly happy to, you know, look at pornography (laughs), to get off on it and, you know, to understand that there was a real difference between the objectification and abuse, sexual abuse of women as we understood it. So for us, you know, what was much more real and interesting and impactful was to figure out what could we do about the sex trade in South Asia and other parts of the world where women and young girls were being treated with such utter, horrible abuse, and that was much more meaningful to us than whether or not people wore dresses or pants or ... you know, and what kind of magazines people got off on.\n",

      "It really did, because the stuff I was learning on my own, a lot of that ... some of it came from Freud, and Bowen is not Freud. It's the whole family, and so I began to understand that it wasn't just victim-perpetrator, that the whole family in some ways were involved. And what I mean by that is that one person in the family moves and it causes everybody else to move. It's like a mobile. You move one part of it and all the rest of it moves. And that was part of the reason why when my family ... it was at that time when my family still was turned against me -- my mother, my father, my brother, my oldest sister, and how wrong I was and that the reason that Richard was in jail was because I had put him there and it was a conspiracy because I was mad at my mother and father for what they had done and that I was a liar and I was crazy and I was nuts and I was making up all of this and nobody wanted to believe or accept or admit what I said was true. Um, and those members of the family and a lot of the extended family members, too, that were still all bound in this horror of child abuse and spouse abuse. One of the things I learned from Bowen is if I can just stay my own, eventually others in the family will change, and that did happen. It happened ... I mean, my younger sisters and so on, they believed what I said and added to it, what had happened to them. And eventually, my brother came around and said, yes, there were other cousins and nieces and nephews that said, yes, we've been abused, too, and eventually my older sister admitted it and my mother has and my brother did before he died. Now there are more people in the family that admit it and say, yes, this happened, than the other that say, no. I really have just one uncle left that still denies\n",

We do provide some counseling in the Women in Transition group, the support group. It's more like an education and mentoring group, it's not run by a psychologist or a counselor. We have people come in that speak with them about the various issues that they want to cover and it's always domestic violence and child abuse.

      "WARD: I think I thought, no wonder I'm so screwed up. (long hearty laugh). Really, I think I did. I thought, God, no wonder. No wonder this and no wonder that, after what I grew up in, you know. And you began to filter that through. This is an example. I remember Harold, all the time we were working I worked in Hanover and he worked in White River, and he would come over, and I would walk down from Hanover and sit on the New Hampshire side of the Ledyard Bridge at the Connecticut River and he would have to come over and pick me up because I wouldn't walk across that bridge. I was deathly scared of walking across bridges with water underneath them. It was all right if they didn't have water underneath it. And I never knew why, never could figure out why, and one time, I remember I came in and he had dropped me off in Vermont. And Harold said, Well, how are you going to get across? I said, Oh, I can do it now. Because I had remembered a time when my father tried to drown me when I was like a year and a half or so old. He was giving me a bath and he was fondling me and I was protesting it and so, he'd stick me under the water, stick my head under the water, and I almost ... I couldn't breathe. And once I remembered that and dealt with that happening and dealt with that fear, I can walk across bridges with water under them all the time now. And I said that to Andy. I said, You know, I wanted to just stand there, walk back and forth, back and forth across that bridge. And he says, Well, that probably would've been all right. They'd have just brought you here anyways. (laugh) And that's the different things that you learn that have stuck with you from what happened to you when you were a child, have come up and you deal with them, and then those fears go away. I could never figure out why I didn't want to stay home alone, and there were times when I would not. I would have someone come stay with me or I'd go stay with someone, and it was all because of the fear of what went on in the nighttime, which is when my father usually abused us. And now, you work through that and I can stay in fine by myself. FOLLET: Uh, huh. WARD: You know, you just work through those things. What it did at that time was [phone rings, voice in background], it allowed me to have respect for myself, to have empathy that I didn't have before, so that was good. FOLLET: Yeah. Um, - WARD: It was about that time, too, that we left from New England and started going cross-country on the trucks and it was after we had dealt with my father. No, let me think. No, that was '93. Oh, and see, we were on the road again, and that was when my niece revealed that she had been abused by my brother. And so during those years I had been doing all this research and so on and learning about child abuse and learning about families, incestuous families and so on (phone rings in background) and so again, the family all turned to me. But I had a good idea of what to do about it then. Much more than what they did, and I knew what needed to happen to help her, and what the rest of the family needed to do. Psychologically I knew. I knew about that. I knew about it being passed down through the generations and who abused who and those different kinds of things. I didn't know the law. I didn't know the law. I knew a lot of the psychological stuff I had learned on my own. I had learned about myself and about other people that went through it and so on.\n",

      "WARD: I think it's because I want people to realize. I recently said, and this is an example, to an opposing client who has finally admitted that he abused his wife and is going into a batterer's intervention program, and we were dealing with supervised visitation for this child, and I said to him, When you get into your batterer's group, you talk with your facilitator. I will be happy to come. Because he was trying to say that the child was only 2 when the battering went on and she didn't really see any of it. So I said, I remember back, vividly, when I was 2 years old and there was abuse going on in my family. And when you get into your group, you ask your facilitator if I can come and talk to you in your group so that you will know what it feels like to be a child and have your parents abusing one another, I said, or to have your father beating your mother. I said, I will be happy to come and talk to you about that and read to yo\n",
      " some of my writings about what that experience is like. I said, Then you will know what it's like to be a child and know what it feels like to be abused and how traumatic and how frightening it is. Because I think that is the way, if I can reach people with that message, that they will realize that it has to stop, that it can't continue on, because if it does, then that's what we're doing to our future generations that we expect to take care of us and expect to take care of the world. So I think it's very important. I often say we will not stop street violence and we will not stop school violence until we stop violence in the home. Because as I said to you yesterday, even though things go on at school that you know are not acceptable at school and they're acceptable at home, deep down inside you learn that it's acceptable anywhere, and you can bring it from the home into the school and onto the streets and so if you can stop it in the home, I think that's the key to where it all starts. And, you know, if - the whole idea that women need to be equal with men and can be equal with men. One of the things that has always turned me against the Bible and against religion is that my father would quote from the Bible while he was, you know, the next minute abusing my mother or abusing one of his daughters, as if he were supported by the Bible for doing this, and would turn it all around. So for a long time I was against the teachings of the Bible, but now, I can look at it more objectively and realize that yes, it's very patriarchal, especially the Old Testament, which is what he would quote from, but now I can look at it and realize that that was the way he interpreted it. FOLLET: Did he quote actual passage to justify actual abuse? WARD: He would ... well, you read the Bible. Nowhere in the Bible does it prohibit father-daughter incest. It prohibits everything else ... brother-sister, um, mother-son, and everything, but father-daughter incest is not prohibited.\n",

      "WARD: Yes, a public spokesperson. My sisters speak openly, my younger sisters, about what happened to them and how wrong it was and how traumatic it was. And they talk amongst their friends or with me or other professionals or whatever. But they're not a public spokesman for it like I am. But they support me. They've heard me speak and listened and have participated in some of the efforts that I have made, whether it's interviewing with reporters or, you know, just giving information and so on. And so they've been helpful. But their lives focus around their children's lives. Where I've been more of a spokesman for it and said that this is wrong and it needs to change and this is how we can change it. And I think that's because ... I don't know if it's because they have children and that has to be their everyday focus. But, in the same instance, I'll tell you that one of my nieces -- she will be here tomorrow, she's meeting a client here, a mutual client, and asking that I represent the children in the case where there has been child sexual abuse. And so that niece is out there working. She works in a child psychology type position, a case manager position for one of the local mental health centers in the area, so she is actively out there and she has three children, but she's actively out there in this area. I have another niece who, in New Jersey, works with the elderly now in nursing homes and so on and does a lot to make sure that the elderly aren't abused. Now that's a niece that my nephew married. It's not a direct blood relation, but ... so there are people in my family that go into the social service area and I think a lot of that is because they see the need and realize ... as the generations come down, even though that generation was not abused, they're still affected by it. You know, just like you talk about the Holocaust. One of my best friends, she's a doctor in Ann Arbor ... her mother was a victim of the Holocaust. So she wasn't, but it affects her still. It affects the generations after that. And so I think that's something that even though my great-nieces and nephews will not be abused, that they will still be affected by what happened in their families\n",

      "of 1989? What had led up that? WARD: I look back at different things that were going on in my life up to that point in time, and in '89 was when Harold and I had bought the second truck. We were really settled in the business, we were doing fairly well. Things were going well. Our own personal relationship, I felt, was going really well. We were more mature than what we'd ever been and comfortable with one another. In other words, I felt safe, you know, I felt safe. And so, at one point in time we had hired somebody to drive with us, to drive for us, and he couldn't drive for some reason, he was sick or something. So we were each operating a truck, and we had done that some, because we had three trucks at the time, so we took on a lot. We had a little trucking business of our own. And so, there were times when I would operate the truck by myself, and it allowed me to think, I think. You know, you're by yourself then and so on. And of course in '89, that was two years, I think, after my niece had revealed that my father had sexually abused her. And at that point in time, I still wouldn't admit even to myself that we had ... that I had been abused. I just said, it didn't happen in my family. Yeah, it happened to other people, but it didn't happen to me. It might have even happened to my older sister or whatever. It happened to some of the others, but I'm sure it didn't happen to me. And I just ... it was one of those things where if you don't allow yourself to think about it, you just say, I'm not going to think about it. I'm not going to think about, that it goes back further enough in your brain so that you don't think about it and you just ... it's like it's a cutoff there. And I say a cutoff, it was almost like there was a curtain drawn there, and yo\n",
      " don't draw that curtain back. Because if you do, God forbid. And that's what it was like. And then, it was almost like when I started to look at what was behind that curtain, there was just like a flood of stuff that came out. And that was all the stuff that I had just stored back there, and had chosen not to talk about it or not even think about for years, since I had left home as a child, really since the time I had been 13 or so. I just, you just don't think about it. It was very easy to do all those years, I think, because there was so much else going on. Harold and I were married and we had his family to think about because his father died. And then my family expected me to solve all of their problems. Whenever anything went wrong, they came to Wynona to solve the problems, and the same with Harold's family. They came to him. So it was just ... you know, it was ... there was so much other going on. Then we had the trucks and we were on road and I ran the business, essentially. And I ran the business side of it and Harold did the mechanical side and ran that part of it. And then we shared the driving. So our lives were really, really hectic and busy. And at that point in time, I think I felt safe enough and secure enough, and was with Harold enough at that point in time so that I could be comfortable and talk about it, and really re-live some of the stuff that went on. And it was a hard time. But it brought Harold and I really close. FOLLET: It did? WARD: Oh, yeah. Because he was there. He was like my everyday shrink, someone that could ... was further enough away from it so it was like he could be almost an objective person about it. Not really, because in some ways, but in other ways he could be. In other ways, he could confirm things for me, too, because he'd known me since I was 13. FOLLET: Right. WARD: I remember when I went to the doctor about whether I had a learning disability or not and I came home and said she wanted me to think about back when I was kid, you know, where there some things I was behind in developing. And I said, You've known me since I was 13. What do you think? And he has this dry sense of humor, so he said, Well, you've always been a klutz. (laugh). And it's true. And it's more than likely because of the learning disability that I have, which was caused from domestic violence. My balance isn't good. It's never been good. And I have a hard time with that. And so it's things like that that he has seen and realized about me, that others wouldn't have known, because he's known me for so long. But at that time, yeah, that's when I really started thinking about it and studying about it and reading about it and realizing that this is what happened in our family. And of course, when my niece revealed that she'd been abused by my father and we went through that whole ordeal, then it was like my sisters and I were really close for a while, a period there, and then we just all pulled apart and went our own separate ways because it was so hard to deal with, so hard to deal with. And they had their families and I was on the road and all of that, and it was very, very difficult to deal with. And they didn't want to deal with it. Nobody wanted to deal with it anymore. Just the same thing as always had happened in the past -- put in on the back burner, it'll go away and it won't happen again. But I didn't let that happen. Instead, I delved into it, and I really wanted to find out what it was all about, and so I did a lot of research on my own. And this was before I was at Vermont College. Whether it was in a bookstore, because when we were hauling different loads, we were in the cities and so on and I could go to a bookstore or wherever and research a lot like that, or could buy books from on the road, and had time to read on the road, where they didn't and they didn't want to deal with it, and so I could pick up these books and read different books about it. I read Judith Lewis Herman's book Father-Daughter Incest. I read Carol Gilligan. I read her book and different books like that I was reading. That's when, I think, how I got my first look at feminism and women and that type of thing was through those books, through Carol Gilligan and Judith Lewis Herman, really. And they were on my own, when I was on the road at that point in time. And I wasn't doing it for school, I was just doing it for myself. The Courage to Heal book, I read that then. Other books about child abuse, and feminist books then, too -- Gloria Steinem and some of those things. I was picking them up and reading them on my own. FOLLET: You were. WARD: Yeah, while we were on the road. FOLLET: Do you remember any ah-hah moments of particular books or particular ideas that really hit home? WARD: Well, of course, Judith Lewis Herman's book Father-Daughter Incest was oh, my God, this is our family. You know, I really think I was at Vermont College before I really started talking about a lot of it. FOLLET: Hm. You talked to Howard, I mean Harold. Sorry. You talked to Harold and you did reading on your own. Did you seek any assistance or- WARD: When things got difficult and I was going through some of the childhood stuff, I saw a psychiatrist for about eight months or so, whenever I could. It was kind of once a week but not really. And just around the psychological stuff of what's going on and how do I handle this and I don't want to see my mother and father anymore and confronting them about what went on and so on, and saw him for about that length of time. And the rest of it was really on my own. I had a friend in California who had ... she had gotten a lot into feminism and that type of thing and so different articles and so on she would refer to me and I would read them, and really started researching on my own on it.

      "WINSLOW: I think I was a mass of contradiction. I was a bleached-blond cheerleader with the nickname of Bubbles who went on civil rights demonstrations. You can't get anything more contradictory than that. And at my fortieth reunion, I talked about how I don't even regret being a cheerleader because I'm always good on demonstrations. I know how to get the crowds going and I tell my women's studies students that. So, I mean, I think maybe being a nonconformist or what have you had to do with the fact that on the one hand, I wanted to be popular, but I wasn't. I wanted to be stereotypically attractive. I wanted a boyfriend. I wanted to do well in school. But on the other hand, there was something seething in me, and when I went away to this private school, I'd come back from a trip to Europe and I got into fights. I mean, think of it: I got into fights with these kids about free love! They thought it was shocking. I didn't believe in marriage. In high school, all you want to do is sleep around. You know, I mean, your hormones are raging. They were shocked at me for that. I was so disliked that the boys named the football dummy, the tackling dummy, after me. Think about that in terms of sexual abuse and violence against women. And I loved the school I was at, and I struggled with it, but it helped make me whatever I am today, if that's good, bad, or indifferent. But I went back to my school to talk about women's issues. They always invite me to speak. And at one point the new headmaster, who was two years younger than me, and had heard about me. At one point, without thinking, he said, \"Barbara, you're really nice.\" And I looked at him and he said, \"You know, the tackling dummy was named after you.\" And it was like, it brought back to me how disliked I was. And his wife, you could just see she was kicking him under the table. And he all of a sudden had this stricken look ... because I know I had a stricken look for a moment ... that this was something. You know, the boys did not like me, and one time we had this co-ed hockey game and the boys came after me with the hockey sticks and I ended up smacking them, I mean, really fighting back. So I think part of me, the combativeness in me, was sort of part of me struggling to figure out who I wanted to be and what I was going to be. So Solebury was very nonconformist. I was at the U.N. demonstrating against the United States in the Cuban Missile Crisis. I mean, we all thought we were going be blown up. And so I got involved in the peace movement through that.\n",

I ran into him at some APA meetings, one of which when I was a resident. He got into an elevator and I was standing there with my residency training director at Harvard, and [Carleton] turned to me and he said, \"Well, hi, Nanette. How nice to see you. Your mother told me to say hello.\" My mother was his patient. That is the most inappropriate thing in the world to say. That is a total breach of confidentiality. I walk out of the elevator, and my residency training director said, \"Who is he?\" I said, \"My mother's psychiatrist.\" I mean, totally embarrassing to me that that had happened. I'd been doing [sex abuse] research. I was already out here. My mother called me a few years after I [moved to San Francisco]. It actually was in the early 1990s. I was working on a big fundraiser for our lesbian health services here 115 in San Francisco, and I had created an idea of a fundraiser that was really successful. I was driving back across the Golden Gate Bridge. It was a time when we had a car phone, and she called me. I said, \"I really can't talk right now. I'm on the bridge.\" She said, \"I have something I have to tell you. I know you've been doing all this work all this time [meaning, on sexual abuse] and I know that you never liked Dr. Carleton.\" She wanted to tell me--she felt like she had to tell me--that she had been sexually involved with him and when she told him that the relationship needed to stop, he had raped her. She also said, \"He also encouraged me to kill your father.\" I was just horrified at all this. \"He encouraged me when we went out sailing to push him overboard. That was before he raped me, before I told him I can't keep seeing him.\" [00:49:42] I contacted the California Licensing Board. He had meanwhile married a patient. I don't know how many patients he--I think there were stories of multiple patients--I don't know how many he married, but he married at least one. The only thing I could think of to do was to contact, again, the California Licensing Board, and I sent them this complaint. I asked my mother if she'd be willing to be named on the complaint. I don't remember the circumstances exactly. She had gone through this complicated decision-making process but I said to them, \"You've got to open a file on him.

      "Marine-Street: One more question related to this. Did you have any knowledge of sexual assaults that were occurring on campus? Was that something that happened then? Gartrell: [00:49:00] Yes, we were told periodically about rapes that happened and women being assaulted outside our dorm. This was starting our first year at Stanford. The lighting was very poor. Our bikes were parked in really dim lighting. I already came to Stanford as a frightened person--worrying about assault and violence. This was not helpful to me at all. We did, as our peer group of women, talk about our fears of going to the library at night. I was petrified of going to the library at night because it involved going out to get my bike where it was dimly lit, where anyone could be grabbed, riding my bike through dark streets to the library, and at both of those places locking the 37 bike. All of these things, if there's nobody else around, made me quite vulnerable and then being in the library, studying until whatever hour, and then making my way back. I was petrified. I mean, from the moment I left the dorm I was petrified. The whole process of thinking about going to the library made me petrified, which meant that I didn't go as often as I wanted to or needed to, which meant that I felt that my [education suffered]. Well, I mean, it was my choice about safety or my fears about safety that prevented me from making adequate uses of the library. At that time, there were no [alarm boxes]. I know now that it seems like every twenty feet, there's an alarm box and I also know that there is [00:50:53] a lot of attention to safety. I'm not talking about the kind of safety that involves drinking alcohol and saying no. I'm talking about just trying to go to the library or trying to go to a night class. I mean, there were things that were happening at night that unless I was going as a member of a group, it didn't feel safe attending. Marine-Street: Did you and any of the other women students do anything to try to feel more safe? Gartrell: [00:51:25] No, we just didn't feel safe and--I mean, it didn't occur to us that we had an opportunity to do anything. Marine-Street: Was there any kind of like self-defense courses or anything? Gartrell: [00:51:37] I don't remember what year it was, but I think it was probably my senior year that a self-defense course was offered, not as an elective but just as a campus activity, and I took it. I found out about it however--going to school at a time when there was no internet, any information you received 38 was word-of-mouth, you happened to have the time to read a flyer in White Plaza, or you happened to have time to read the Stanford Daily, or you had access to the Daily regularly, which I didn't always, especially if I was living off-campus. It was really a matter of luck if you found out about something that you really wanted to do and needed to do. But somehow I found out about it. I attended this class and I loved it. I loved the concept of being taught that I was entitled to pay attention to my fears and that whenever I did feel afraid--whenever something happened that made me feel more afraid--I should pay attention to my feelings because they were a good indicator of my potential risk. My lover who had sex with men before she met me, [and] had sex with men throughout the time she was with me--she was not comfortable being lesbian, didn't want to identify as lesbian, wanted to get married, [and] spent the whole time that I was at Stanford looking for a man to marry at the same time she was involved with me--always said, \"Oh, you're just a wimp, you know, stop being so afraid. What are you so afraid of? You're so afraid of sex with men? Why are you so uptight? You're just incredibly uptight?\" Always the message, \"You are really, really uptight.\" To have this validation in this self-defense class that paying attention to [my feeling of fear]--granted, I came from a background of more fear that I carried within me than I wish I ever did--but that if something kicked it up to a higher level, that my feelings were valid and I needed to pay attention to them and I needed to do something about them immediately. Then to learn self-defense techniques to fight or to fight back or to release myself was 39 fabulous. It was such an incredible opportunity to have--to create a sense of empowerment. Marine-Street: Was it a male instructor, do you remember? Gartrell: [00:54:27] Absolutely not. It was all women. Marine-Street: All women? Gartrell: [00:54:29] Yes, I wouldn't have taken a course from a man because how could a man possibly have come from our experience and seen the world in the way we saw the world? Marine-Street: It was another student that was doing it? Do you recall? Gartrell: [00:54:45] Yes, I believe it was another student or somebody from offcampus who came. Marine-Street: Do you remember where they taught the classes? Gartrell: [00:54:52] They were taught in the Roble Gym. Marine-Street: Does anything stick with you about what they taught you like specific techniques? Gartrell: [00:55:03] They were techniques about releasing yourself if someone grabs you and there were techniques about the most vulnerable [ways] to fight back if you were assaulted. I go from that, fast forward to many years later when I got to know Pauline Bart who was a very eloquent writer about rape and women fighting back. She did studies about women who were trained to or learned to fight back versus women who were trained to lie down and take it. I had heard always growing up that if you're assaulted; you're going to be killed if you fight back--until I took this class. 40 When I got to Pauline Bart's readings and then got to know her as a colleague and heard that there were actual data that the women who fought back, very often, got away and were not raped versus those who submitted were a hundred percent raped. There was no guarantee they weren't going to be killed. It was an incredibly eye-opening experience. Marine-Street: I'll say. Let's take a quick break. Gartrell: [00:56:29] Okay. [End of Part 1 of 5 - Interview with Nanette Gartrell - August 29, 2018] 41 42 STANFORD UNIVERSITY PROJECT: STANFORD PIONEERING WOMEN ALUMNAE ORAL HISTORY PROJECT INTERVIEWEE: NANETTE GARTRELL INTERVIEWER: NATALIE MARINE-STREET DATE OF INTERVIEW: AUGUST 29, 2018 PART: 2 OF 5 Marine-Street: Before we move on, is there anything else you'd like to say about the selfdefense course? Gartrell: [00:00:06] One other thing that just came to mind is in Pauline Bart's research about lying down and taking it versus fighting back--and fighting back included using strategies to extract yourself. There were accounts that she provided of women who actually talked men who had weapons out of their weapons and then managed to escape without being assaulted. It's really quite phenomenal but not only did she find that if you do fight back or use a strategy to escape that you have a chance of not being sexually violated. But even if you were raped and you fought back, that the psychological sequelae for those who resisted versus those who didn't was dramatically different. That is fascinating. That was always fascinating to me. The fighters ultimately did better than those who thought that they had to comply and didn't try any strategies. Not that they're to be blamed-those who are to be blamed are the police and the men who told us, \"Don't 43 resist, don't resist.\" They are to be blamed, and I have strong feelings about that.\n",

Although, my mother was very close to her sisters and her two brothers, and one brother died in the war, World War II. She only had the one. The other brother was an alcoholic, but he was fun, too. He would come around, and he just smelled of alcohol. He wasn’t violent. Apparently my grandfather hadn’t been violent, either, but the violence came out in my mother. I’m sure it was stored up. Who knows? She was on the streets a lot as a kid. They put her into foster homes, and she would run away. She and this brother were often separated, but they would both leave and then be on the streets. I’m sure she was sexually abused, the things that can happen to little kids if they have no supervision, and those would all be sins in the world view she had embraced with Baptists. You wouldn’t talk about that. \n",

      "One of the things that brought me to Rape Crisis was the desire to be more of an advocate. When you&#8217;re a Judicial Officer, you can&#8217;t be an advocate. You have to be really balanced and you can support students who are in front of you and you can help them know what their resources are and where they can go, but you have to really balance that, if you&#8217;re the Judicial Officer, you have to see the whole picture and make sure everybody&#8217;s getting fair judgment. Honestly, wanting to be more overtly, do more overt advocacy was part of what drew me to the Rape Crisis Center. Because you&#8217;re always in different roles. SB: Interesting. It&#8217;s knowing the whole picture, coming to the Rape Crisis Center but you had to know what it was like to be a respond\n",
      "ng party within the system. That sounds like a really valuable set of experiences. MB: Yeah, I mean it was different. For me it was nice to have more focus on one issue. Sexual violence is obviously broader than one issue. So it&#8217;s very broad. But coming from UNC I was dealing with academic dishonesty; I was dealing with substance abuse issues, alcohol, sexual violence, student crises, suicide prevention, all of this wide range of issues. And so it was freeing to come and focus more directly on one issue that&#8217;s really important and that intersects with so many other issues in a lot of ways. And that&#8217;s one of the things I love about the Rape Crisis Center is that it stayed true to its mission and a really focused mission, and sometimes there&#8217;s temptations to bring issues together which you do to solve problems, but I think sexual violence especially lends itself to getting submerged if you don&#8217;t have something that focuses directly on it. So I&#8217;ve been really proud that the Rape Crisis Center has continued to have rape in the name for example. And that was a debate that every once in a while would come up in my years. I think it always does. \"Oh, should we consider changing the name? Should we make it broader?\" And ultimately folks would always go back to the sign on Estes Drive.\n",

[Interrupted by PA system announcement] As well as political rights of women in certain countries and where they haven&#8217;t been really exercised. I&#8217;m doing a little bit of work in Rwanda right now, which is such a fascinating country full of contradictions. I mean most any country is but that one is very close to the surface so it&#8217;s gotten a lot of press as having the highest percentage of women in elected office in the parliament there. JW: Mm hmm. BB: And it&#8217;s true, they&#8217;re there, but there&#8217;s this huge gap, enormous gap, [what&#8217;s going on with the men in that country.] I think a lot more about how you help women develop the skills and knowledge to be active in formal political arenas, much more than I did when I was younger, both in Rwanda or in this country also. I mean I&#8217;d say that women in Afghanistan that I know have a much stronger sense of themselves as needing to be politically active in their community than women here do. I worked for a couple of years with literacy programs in small rural communities in Afghanistan where women are learning to take a real active role in the community development councils and doing all these things that are pretty exciting.

In taking a rights based approach to education or this international work I&#8217;m doing, I&#8217;ve often thought about what would it mean to take a rights based approach.

I remember we would sit together and we would often have a topic, and topics would be your parents, or how you were raised to think about sports, sex. I know I remember one evening it was about sexual abuse, and I had not thought about it since I was a child, but when I was twelve I was abused by a friend of my mom and dad&#8217;s, and it was horrible. It was traumatic. I had repressed it, and because we were talking about it in this group I remembered it, but I didn&#8217;t remember-&#8211;. I wasn&#8217;t ashamed of it anymore because every single woman in the group, every one, had either been raped or abused in some way, every woman. One friend of mine was talking about she was hitchhiking in her hometown and this guy that she knew picked her up and raped her, and I don&#8217;t think she even reported it. But it was everybody, so that&#8217;s such a good example of \"the personal is political,\" because when women are abused or raped, often we are ashamed of ourselves and we hide it, and my parents certainly never-&#8211;. I never told my parents. I never opened my mouth. I just turned into this really angry little girl for a couple of years and I hated my mother, because part of the way that I was raised in those days, adults were right and children weren&#8217;t. You respected adults and you weren&#8217;t taught, like kids are now, that it&#8217;s okay to tell if someone does something. But that was that meeting that night that I remembered it and I went through. It raised my consciousness about women and about experience\n",

      "HC: Oh, yeah, you see a lot of it, and you want to try to get back at the children at an early age, and we focus on two to five, really younger, two to three, to try to give them some self esteem and try to prepare them for crisis as much as possible in a school environment, because that&#8217;s what their lives are. There&#8217;s going to be crisis. They go into homes that aren&#8217;t adequate. They&#8217;re exposed to things that most people aren&#8217;t exposed to at those ages because of the confinement of where they live. They can&#8217;t escape it, that&#8217;s the trouble. They can&#8217;t escape to a place of safety. They&#8217;re trapped in a four hundred square foot trailer with thin walls so they&#8217;re exposed to sexual acts, they&#8217;re exposed to pornography, they&#8217;re exposed to all kinds of junk that normal children can get away from, they can escape from. These children can&#8217;t and if you see an abusive situation you&#8217;ll find that they&#8217;re trapped even more so because the care givers won&#8217;t let them out of the environment, so they trap them in a trailer, say. They won&#8217;t go to daycares, they won&#8217;t go to preschool, they don&#8217;t go to Head Start and people never know they&#8217;re there, so by the time they get into the school system and they&#8217;ve been abused they don&#8217;t make it, and there&#8217;s a lot of them. And I&#8217;m not just talking about sexual abuse; I&#8217;m talking emotional and physical.

It&#8217;s short term, it&#8217;s not effective, so another area I really want to work on, and I&#8217;m trying to work on this now, is getting mental health up there with video conferencing, because we can&#8217;t get psychiatrists up there. There&#8217;s a friend of mine who works with Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and we&#8217;ve been up to the hospital to talk to them about putting a video conferencing center up there and using the psychiatrist down here to work the counseling, so that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re working on. We&#8217;re trying to get the state more aware of the abuse problem and do something about it so we are trying to do things, but the problem is so deep rooted and so severe that it&#8217;s--. We&#8217;re trying to do little things at a time, I guess, but the focus is on those children. It&#8217;s still on those children. DC: And you&#8217;ve got to get to them that young, is what I&#8217;m hearing. HC: Oh, I think so. You&#8217;ve got to get them--.

I wish we could go on to five and six and teach them as much as--I mean older--what they should do and shouldn&#8217;t do. We always find, I guess, that when they get into high school, they get out of that grammar school in eighth grade and they start going to high school, that&#8217;s when they start--. Now the girls that are severely abused, I would say they probably never get--. They might get into high school but I doubt if they&#8217;re capable of getting through it because they have personality disorders and all kinds of situations.

      "GE: Yeah. I started one in California, in San Francisco. There was one group of us, a small group there. A couple of women were flight attendants. Actually, almost all the women I knew either were, or had been, flight attendants. And in fact, I have two friends now who I&#8217;ve known since we were flight attendants together, who I&#8217;m still friends with. They both live on the west coast, they both live in the Seattle area. It&#8217;s funny. And one of them who had been my roommate, her daughters are my godchildren. So we still have that connection. So all the women either were, or had been, flight attendants, who were in this consciousness-raising group. And some of that was also from the union, because some of the women in the union, some of the women I flew with who were in the union, and who were active in the union were more political. And truthfully, it was San Francisco, and so probably as a group we were more feisty and political than some of the other places. So anyway, yeah, we had a consciousness-raising group there. And then when I came back here, I started one here. I think those were really big. I think those were really--. It&#8217;s hard. This probably sounds inflated and pompous to say that they we were really revolutionary, but in a way they really were. Because it was the only time, for all of us, it was the only time we ever really got to talk about those, or had a chance to even explore with each other, \"Gee, have you ever been to the doctor and they did this to you?\" Or talking about people who had been sexually abused, or raped--. I mean, that was never, ever talked about. So it truly was a liberating experience for people to be able to talk about that with each other, and find out that we had so many things in common, as far as those experiences as women. And the sad part of it was that often it didn&#8217;t go anywhere. You just shared all that, and then you felt personally empowered, but it didn&#8217;t necessarily lead to any action, which is always the case with us, with \"lefties,\" right? We talk a lot, but we don&#8217;t always take action. But it was incredible. It was an incredible part of the foundation of women&#8217;s awakening, if you will. And I think that some of the women&#8217;s work that I did in the [19]80s and &#8217;90s was that way, too. It was kind of, women opening up to each other and being able to say things they couldn&#8217;t say anywhere else. It was pretty important stuff.\n",

The federal government&#8217;s mindset was in order to save the man we must kill the Indian. They were not allowed to wear any of their traditional clothing, their hair was cut, and for many Native Americans that act alone is an indicator that someone has died, and so when they were forced to cut their hair then a lot of those children would mourn because they thought that a death had occurred. They were forced to wear uniforms. The mindset was that the indigenous people of the North American continent, all Native American tribes, were not intelligent enough to become professionals, so the females were taught to be seamstresses, maids, of that nature, you know, laundry workers, and of course the male students were trained to be laborers and carpenters\n",

I mean women are still by a sigm...cant portion of the population regarded as inferior to men, and I just wonder linguistically what do we have to do to address this. What's it going to take? How many dead women do we have to pile up before we realize that we've got blinders up or we've got our fingers in our ears and we're saying la-la-la or both?

The abuser commits the act, and then the state allows him to get away with it. So I really don't know what it's going to take. I hope the film is going to make people stop and think and say, \"I wonder what goes on in my community. I wonder how battered women are treated in my court.

So I stayed on the job and I, the agency was a Rape Crisis Center and it started doing Domestic Violence and I had a couple of children and I knew that I probably would not be able to do direct services for long because there was not a systematic answer to stop what I was seeing. And for somebody who always thought that I could figure out an answer to the unjust and to the things that aren't fair I didn't have an answer to them. Society didn't, which still doesn't quite make sense to me and I've been doing this work now for almost seventeen years. I'm still not sure how as a society we don't keep our children safe and I think that was another turning point for me to realize that, \"Okay I can't do direct services because clearly I don't have children. I cannot take all of these children into my home.\" I was in my twenties. That probably was not going to ...‚y with my now husband either that I was bringing a bunch of kids home. The threats from perpetrators and abusers never bothered me. I didn't fear people who used physical or sexual Violence to have power over someone so I was never afraid. And it was a small town so I had quite a few threats but those things never bothered me. It was the children. I, I just didn't know why as a society nobody thought to make it their job to ...gure out how to keep them safe. So intervention is still really important to me. It was important to me then, but I left there knowing that there had to be another side to the work that I was doing in the local community.

And so the Executive Director said,\" I think you should apply because it's where your passion started and how do you work with college campuses to help them deal with sexual assault on college campuses.\" So I came here in 1999 to do rape prevention education on college campuses and to write a sexual assault model policy for college campuses.

And that's when I chose, because I had not even chosen a senior topic and so I chose a senior topic and I chose sexual assault because my freshman year somebody was sexually assaulted. I'm telling you this out of chronological order because it matters in the scheme of things. So somebody was sexually assaulted by a football player and I, she came to my dorm room and my room is called \"The rec\" and it had R-E-C like recreation center because I went to college with a big TV and radio that's all not here or there [KL laughs], but I went to college with way too much stuff that wasn't really necessary for a college dorm. They didn't know. They knew I needed a TV and radio so they were like, \"Sure!\" 16 Monika Iohnson-Hostler So anyways she came to the rec to tell us what happened and that was my first introduction to rape or sexual assault or knowing anybody who openly said that they were sexually assaulted. And she told us what happened, but she didn't want to do anything. She didn't want to tell anybody. She just needed to tell somebody because she walked into the dorm crying, distraught, what have you. So I said, \"Oh we can do something.\" She said \"Well, I don't want to do anything.\" And so I was trying to ...gure out what we could do without saying who it was and it was football players. And so I thought we could take on the football players and I did. Needless to say, nothing changed for them. However they will remember that that's when it sparked for me that, \"Oh, there's agencies that do something about this so we should at least have information available for people, for young women,\" and so rape crisis stuff became available in our dorms because I just didn't know what else to do at that point. So that's what I did I ...gured out who would know what to do. So that is how I chose my senior topic and I interviewed the Rape Crisis Center of Cumberland County and decided, \"Oh this is pretty interesting. Like people can do this for a living and I don't have to be a p\n",
      "ychiatrist to actually help people?\" And so I did the paper and, a joint paper actually. I did it on African Americans who were sexually assaulted because then I became intrigued by incest and child sexual abuse and how it became very much a family thing. And of course I really only did African Americans because I was one and wanted to be able to ask my family who clearly was not interested in disclosing all these things. But I really had more of a conversation with my grandmother and my great aunt because I wanted a perspective from them, given everything was swept under the rug then. 17 Monika Iohnson-Hostler So I wrote the paper and I knew I was going to graduate in December and by that time I had already met who now is my husband. We had started dating that last year that I was at school and I didn't know when I wanted to get my Masters then because I knew I wasn't going to take any biology or botany [KL and PV laugh, 25:00]. So I didn't really know what a career choice was. I just knew that I wanted to do something to help people. And the thing that I always will say about Thomasville High School and the Thomasville School Systems, which they knew very little I would say, but they knew how to score aptitude tests and it was right. In the seventh grade a teacher told me, \"You will do something to help people. That's innately who you are and it's what matters to you and it's what is important.\" She said \"You scored very well in all of these other things, but everything came back to people.\" And that's true; it's in my DNA somehow. And so my husband, who is not my husband got a job in a small town in Scotland county as a math teacher and he called me because he graduated before I did and he was like, \"There's a job at a rape crisis center and it is just now opening,\" and I was like, \"Oh, why not?\" So I went to interview with two people and I stood up to walk out and they were like \"So when can you start work?\" I was twenty, I wasn't even twenty-one yet and I was like, I'm pretty sure there are some question I should be asking, but since I didn't know what they were. I said, \"I will call you back.\" So at any rate, so we had a conversation and they officially offered me the job.\n",

      "So at NC CASA we're a statewide organization that is a membership organization for the ninety plus rape crisis centers in North Carolina. So every county is served by a rape crisis center but there are about sixty-three court agencies that have offices in about ninety-two counties. But then they have staff covering the other eight counties that there are not a physical of...ce for sexual assault. So they provide direct services which is what I did in Scotland County for many years. But we do the training for those advocates. We also do law \n",
      "nforcement training on sexual assault specifically so impact of sexual Violence, prevalence and how to interview sexual assault survivors. We also train sexual assault nurse examiners forensic nurses on evidence collection and the importance of the survivor because what they do is scientific and what we do is let them know that that is a human being that is the evidence. And so we provide training there. We also provide training for anybody who needs it. We have a campus consortium which now we have probably over forty campuses who are a part of our campus consortium so they have their own advisory committee of campuses and we provide prevention training to them and with them because a lot of them now have federal grants that they have at their school universities to do sexual Violence or domestic Violence preventions; but we do the sexual assault side ofthings. And we also work with all of the state agencies on writing model policies. So we just wrote a policy on new research because I wrote one in 99. There wasn't a lot of research but now there's lots of research. And we also have an administration, our presidential administration who has this as a priority issue. So of course it helps to have the Vice 24 Monika Iohnson-Hostler president that has a, \"One is too many,\" website on sexual assault that happens on college campuses. So that's a huge initiative for us, which we want to work on with the department of public health. You all interviewed the council for women so you all know they're a funder and we are, statutorily the coalition provides training to the agencies that they fund which are the rape crisis centers. So they fund direct services and we train direct service providers. So there is a lot ofturnover because now that I'm older I know that they really don't make a lot of money to do work that is stressful and that absolutely has a high turnover and burnout rate. I just did my ...rst career fair at my daughter's elementary school and I realized this is not a career that anyone will ever tell you that you can ever have. So I'm looking in her yearbook and it actually has where I work, but they asked me to come talk about being a non-pro...t director and I said, \"Well that is really great of them to put where I work,\" because now somebody knows that is a career. Because even in college this isn't a career choice you'd think that you would do. Even women's studies majors, a lot of them think about policy which is now where I now spend the bulk of my time. So that's what we do our work revolves around training and education for direct service providers whether they are rape crisis centers or we call them allied professionals or first responders who would be involved in a sexual assault case, and then campuses. But we also do prevention work, which is also training people how to do prevention so society systematically understands that it is our job to change to prevent children from being sexually abused, not children and not just singularly parents but systems are also a part of that. So we do systems work as 25 Monika Iohnson-Hostler well which is mostly translated into policy. So we do both state and federal policy and so, which there will be a trend here. So in that I'm also the chair of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, which I have been for, my daughter's six so almost six years. I know that's a long time to be a chair [all laugh]. But it is a policy making body so all of our work and there's no staff so we're all volunteer so I tell people my 6-10 job which is when I leave here is to work with federal policy. That is in both writing and advocating for it, and that advocacy isn't just to Congress on the importance of passing legislation but it's also to agencies so that they understand why it's important that the policy governs their work. So that's my current focus, as a public policy in legislation.\n",

      "I was not as active on the local level, but I joined NOW and all those good old great ones and became a real advocate for not just social workers, but women in those positions, women in the field. So that&#8217;s been my focus all these years. I&#8217;m a very verbal person, and so I made lots of speeches when I was with-the next program that I worked in in Child and Family was the Project Against Sexual Abuse of Appalachian Children. So that included, as I shared with you on the phone, I think, that agency had sort of a research project that started with setting up a helpline in 1979. The helpline was for women and children to call in and report just to the helpline or just to talk about their abuse, primarily sexual abuse was the target. And that meant any women that had been sexually abused as a child or were still or had been raped or a child that had been molested or somehow been offended sexually. So that sort of experiment or, in research terms, sort of out there to gather data, that following next year, the referrals to the Department of Human Services went up four hundred percent. So that data was used to support getting the funding for a regional research and service delivery system for abuse victims and so that&#8217;s where the Project Against Sexual Abuse of Appalachian Children. It&#8217;s an unwieldy name, but PASAAC, and I was clinical supervisor there for six years. So I did a lot of speaking at that time throughout the southeast. And what we did was try to get the various parts of the systems that deal with abuse to talk to each other. Police-if a rape was reported, how do they talk to the victim? What kind of services were available at the emergency center, the emergency rooms? Of course, the Department of Human Services that gave services to children, often they weren&#8217;t communicating with anybody. The sheriff&#8217;s department, the police, all of those people needed to coordinate services and learn how to not do further damage because the interrogation, particularly around rape, man, it was almost as bad as the rape sometimes for women. So we advocated strongly for that to change and for a more humane, more private inquiry, and did a lot of training throughout the southeast all the way from Texas to South Carolina, Florida. JW: Was there openness to that kind of change or what was that process like? RJ: What was that process? (laughs) Well, the big resistance, you can imagine, was from [males].We wanted to include doctors and many physicians would not, were the most resistant group. And I&#8217;m not sure why that was. I think a lot of that was because there weren&#8217;t very many women physicians at that point. And I think that, number one, a lot of men had not been trained to really see rape as [a crime]. They saw it as, well, did she have any injuries, was she pregnant, and that&#8217;s it, and not any of the psychological impact of being assaulted that way. JW: Were you trying to get them to report cases? RJ: Yes, definitely trying to get, well, trying to help them help the victim, to take charge, and to talk about it. A lot of women still won&#8217;t talk about being raped because back then, of course, there was very anti-female [attitude]. First of all, rape didn&#8217;t exist. Number two, if you were raped, you asked for it, you wanted it, because you wore that skirt too short or you were being seductive or you didn&#8217;t say \"no\" loud enough. Why did you finally give in? Nobody can [be raped]. It was a lot of old boy things: \"Well, nobody gets raped. If you don&#8217;t want to have sex then you just say no.\" But the fact that the man was two hundred and fifty pounds and the woman was a hundred had nothing to do with it. So there was a lot of denial of inequities, physical strength and intimidation, and then the women often felt so guilty and so dirty. All she wanted to do was forget it, and so there was not much follow-up for the mental health [treatment]. So as the next project that I worked on, as clinic supervisor at the Sexual Assault Center, which was an agency designed specifically to work with women and children. [The] women that had been sexually assaulted or had been sexually abused as children and were still dealing with the trauma. So I ran a group for nine years for women that had been sexually assaulted or had reoccurring memories. The whole memory thing got really to be an issue. And then, of course, I had staff that worked with children that had been abused, a lot of play therapy and those kinds of things. JW: And what year did you start that? RJ: Oh gosh. I left Child and Family in &#8217;86-no, I started in private practice in &#8217;86. I left Child and Family in &#8217;84. I went with Overlook Mental Health Center for a couple years and then I went in private practice. And when I went in private practice in &#8217;86, then that&#8217;s when I associated also with the Sexual Assault Center. There was three of us on staff, four on staff at the time and so I was the clinical supervisor and then we started adding staff. I was there for fifteen years on some level. JW: So how were you learning to counsel people through this when, like you said, rape didn&#8217;t exist? You were part of that movement to say, \"Wait a second. It does.\" RJ: It does exist and it has more than physical impact on the victim. Well, how were we learning that? Well, learning how to be a counselor, quote, therapist. Counseling usually is around solving problems, defining problems and solving problems in a real sort of one, two, three way. That&#8217;s my definition. Now therapy is a much longer and more in-depth look at how you reacted to the problem on an emotional level and what that did to your mental health. What has it done? Do you find yourself depressed, staying in bed all day long, or continuing to get into self-destructive, abusive relationships? That takes a long time to figure out how to break those patterns and we&#8217;re now learning a whole lot more about the brain. If I had time to go, I&#8217;d be a neurologist. I would study that and how to educate people to train their brain differently. We know that can happen now. We have the technology, and we have the expertise. But anyway, back to how do you learn how to deal with somebody about a behavior or an event that supposedly doesn&#8217;t happen. (laughs) Well, the first thing you do is say, \"It does happen.\" And again, since we&#8217;re products of our culture, you have to do a lot of work on yourself, or at least I did, in saying, \"Yeah, that happens and yes, it&#8217;s not good and yes, most of the victims are women, but also little boys get raped and vulnerable males also get raped.\" So you have to sort of retrain your own thinking about that and disconnect yourself from the common belief system. It has some service in the community to deny certain things and so you have to figure out, okay, if I rock the boat, what happens? What role do I play? It&#8217;s like the whole thing with women, the women&#8217;s movement. There was this thought that women, you can have it all. You can&#8217;t have it all. You have to make choices. You can&#8217;t be the CEO of a multimillion-dollar corporation and be there every time your kid has a fever. You can&#8217;t do it. So you make choices.\n",

      "RJ: Well, how has it been slow to change? JW: Or has it been? Has this mostly been a positive story of success? RJ: Well, in some ways for some people it has. I think there&#8217;s still a lot of, and I&#8217;m thinking of just a great influence on people&#8217;s attitudes on sex generally and then, concomitant of that, the misuse of sex to control somebody, which is essentially [abuse]. Rape is not about sex. It&#8217;s about violence and control, because if you want to have good sex, you don&#8217;t rape. And sexual overtures to a child essentially, those people, in my humble opinion, do not have power any place else or they don&#8217;t feel powerful in any place else. So it&#8217;s not about the use of your sexual self for pleasure or for connection. It&#8217;s about violence, psychological violence if not physical violence, on another person. So how have we changed? I&#8217;m not so sure that television and popular media doesn&#8217;t sometimes glorify non-consensual sex and it certainly, I don&#8217;t think, creates enough distaste for prostitution and those areas that females get entrapped maybe. I know that some of your audience would probably say, \"Well, there&#8217;s choice there too.\" Anyway, so we&#8217;ve both been changing toward appreciation for the individual and individual choice and for women, but we&#8217;ve also degraded, to some degree, the whole process of sexuality and made it entertainment and/or a power play. It&#8217;s kind of sad in a lot of ways. I&#8217;m at the age where I don&#8217;t want to sound like a curmudgeon and blah blah blah blah, the world&#8217;s going to the dogs, but I have spent my whole career, adult life, advocating for women and for choice and for equality in all arenas. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve got there yet. What is real discouraging at times is to see women who get power and also become abusive and not nice, not helpful, not nurturing. We know of those folks. That&#8217;s really sad. So maybe it&#8217;s the power in the human family that&#8217;s the culprit, not necessarily discrimination based on male-female, but it&#8217;s on the power group versus the un-empowered. It&#8217;s possible for us to destroy ourselves as a species. So have we made progress? I don&#8217;t know, but the human community is very slow. Again, I think our brain is slow to change. And once we get an idea, it&#8217;s very hard to change back and say, \"Hmm, maybe, maybe the best place for children is not eight to ten hours a day in daycare.\" \n",

      "I had a woman friend, her name was Johnnie Ray, so we would help each other, and she was a country woman, the real thing. I&#8217;m the real thing now, but I wasn&#8217;t then. She was very helpful to me and taught me a lot of good stuff and we worked in each other&#8217;s fields. Let me tell you this; this is an important story. So, I don&#8217;t know if you know Grassy Fork or that area. Back thirty or forty years ago\"all the roads back in there are paved now, which amuses me since my road isn&#8217;t paved and that&#8217;s much more of a road\"but it was really a remote section of the county and it was very rough roads. Nothing was paved back in there, which made me happy. I was happy to disappear into the woods. At the fork of the road I lived on there was a cement block building which was probably maybe the size of like the front of the house to the end of the house, maybe thirty feet long and maybe sixteen feet wide. It had a back door and it had a front door and it had two front windows and that was it. There was nothing to it. I was coming out one day and I saw Johnnie&#8217;s truck parked there so I stopped and looked in and there she was, and I said, \"What are you doing?\" because she had a farm and four kids and she had a son-of-a-bitch for a husband, too. Oh, [Laughs] and I had done the same thing with Johnnie Ray one day. I was out at her place or she&#8217;d come down to me and Johnnie had all this stuff all over her arms, and I said, \"Johnnie, have you got ringworm or did you run into some poison, or what&#8217;s going on with you?\" She looked at me like I was really an idiot and she said, \"Those are bruises.\" It turns out that her husband, Paul was just--. He was a drunk and he was the kind that used drink as an excuse and I mean he raped and pillaged and beat. I&#8217;m sure he raped all of his kids, not to mention Johnnie, and beat her and the kids to a bloody pulp time and time again. Also, lucky for me, he was also a cop fighter so that was greatly in our favor because he fought cops and cops don&#8217;t like cop fighters. Anyway, I&#8217;d already found out about the bruising and when I stopped at that building that day and said, \"What are you doing here?\" she said, \"That&#8217;s a steel door, steel door, got bars over both those windows, and he can&#8217;t burn this building.\" And so she rented that little building probably for about thirty bucks a month, I don&#8217;t know, not much. I don&#8217;t know if there was an outhouse there. It was electric, there was an electric line and she had a refrigerator. She had a little counter not as big as this table and on the counter she had like two loaves of light bread and three onions and some bananas and some Beanie Weenies or something. That was her stock from the store. [Sighs] Many a night Johnnie would run out of the house, grab the kids, and she&#8217;d lock herself in that building, many, many a night. So, it was Christmas day 1975, probably 2:00 in the afternoon maybe, and I had a call. It was Gracie, one of her daughters, and I guess Gracie was nine. She said, \"Mama says come quick.\" So I jumped in my little VW bug, and she lived probably, I don&#8217;t know, maybe five miles up the mountain from me. I got up there in time and there was a deputy up there. So Christmas Eve they&#8217;d finished the tree and got all the presents out and they were waiting for Paul to come home, and he never came home that night. The next morning they waited for him to come home all morning to open presents and he didn&#8217;t come home. They went ahead and opened presents, and they waited and waited on Christmas dinner for him to come home and he didn&#8217;t come home, and they'd been up all night, so they eat Christmas dinner early and they ate dinner, and she had fallen asleep. Johnnie had fallen asleep on the couch and she woke up and he was standing over her with a knife at her throat saying, \"You&#8217;re going to die, bitch.\" Johnnie was a strong woman, she&#8217;d been fighting him for years, and he was drunk, and so they struggled and struggled and struggled. And Gracie went into the bedroom and got the pistol that Johnnie kept loaded under her pillow, because it wasn&#8217;t the first time this had happened, and Gracie threw the pistol across the room, tossed it across the room to Johnnie--I mean you can just imagine it, screaming [1:02:24]--and Johnnie caught the pistol and it went off. Now he&#8217;s got the--I mean he&#8217;s after her with the knife. The bullet slices right through here and gets his--aorta? Is that what it is? And so he was bleeding to death. She called the law and called the ambulance and blah, blah, blah, but he died. I got up there in time. The ambulance had just left and the deputy was just waiting for me to get up there so I could keep the kids so they could haul her off, and they hauled her off to jail, Christmas day, hauled her off to jail, charged her with first degree murder, manslaughter. I think they released her late that night because I think we had the kids back to her the next day. So she was charged with murder, and she was convicted of murder, even though it was clearly self defense. They didn&#8217;t think anything about convicting her for murder, and then they let her go. And they laughed about it because Paul was a cop fighter and he&#8217;d had big fights with the cops for years and they hated him and he was always dangerous to them, too. They would make jokes about it: \"Good going, Johnnie!\" and stuff like that. Well she was devastated. I mean the more you suffer the more emotional attachment you have. They&#8217;d been abused for years horribly, but that d\n",
      "esn&#8217;t mean the emotional attachment isn&#8217;t there. It was horrible for her, convicted of murdering her husband who she hated and loved, and being joked about at the courthouse about, \"Good going,\" you know, \"That&#8217;s great!\" They&#8217;d pat her on the back; horrible. I discovered in that time that there were no laws [Laughs] to protect family members. Basically a man could assault his family at will, rape, beat, terrorize, whatever he wanted to do, and the law and the preachers and everybody went, oh, well that&#8217;s his business.\n",

      "LM: I think one of the things that&#8217;s interested me is how men began to change attitudes as their daughters graduated from college and started looking for jobs. I saw a sea change in attitude because their girls were facing what a lot of the rest of us had faced. I think it became clear that the path was not get a college degree, get married, and have babies. So I think there became a change that started in the late [19]70s and continued. I&#8217;m proud of what we did. I am very disgusted, angry, frustrated over what I see is part of a religious-seeming religious, I guess, I don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s all coming from-of trying to put the genie back in the bottle, trying to put women back into--. And they&#8217;re using Roe v. Wade and birth control and all. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a generational situation where people are fearful, but I feel like some of the things that we accomplished, we&#8217;re losing. I mean, to pass a bill that requires the IRS to look into the tax situation of women who have been raped, there&#8217;s something sick going on. When Congress is spending all this time and our state legislature all this time on all of these non-issues, it&#8217;s like the war on women. That&#8217;s what some people are calling it, and I think that&#8217;s very accurate. I think the war on teachers is almost a war on women. You espouse education as important and, yet, you&#8217;re trying to take rights away from teachers. I don&#8217;t get it. So I&#8217;m very angry about that because I think we&#8217;re trying to step back to a time--. And people keep talking about, oh, how it was in the [19]50s. Well, bullshit. (laughs) The &#8217;50s were not the be [all] and [end] all. I think women were stuck in family situations. They didn&#8217;t have the independence to get out of abusive situations. There was no women&#8217;s crisis center, women&#8217;s sexual assault center. There was no support network in that era.\n",

      "So my faith was becoming more and more strong as I sought, and I also became more comfortable with a little doubt on the edges, because all of us doubt, and I also believe God&#8217;s big enough to handle our doubt. So what happened was a woman came to my house and said, \"I need to tell you a story.\" She said, \"My son&#8211;.\" We had heard that a pedophile who was associated with Providence Baptist had been arrested &#8211; and by the way he&#8217;s serving thirteen years &#8211; and that he had molested a fair number of young teen boys, and he had been a volunteer [from the] seminary and he worked with all the youth. EF: The seminary in Raleigh? DP: Yeah, Southeastern Seminary. I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean to&#8211;. EF: Oh, that&#8217;s okay. DP: Assume Southeastern when I talk about more fundamentalism, alright? EF: Okay, got it. DP: That might help. EF: Sure. DP: He molested kids, and I found out how bad, and I wanted to tell you that, as a nurse who had worked with child sex abuse victims, this was amongst some of the worst sexual abuse I have ever heard in my life. I can&#8217;t even speak of it, it makes me so sick. This young man, who was fourteen at the time, and his name is Aaron &#8211; he&#8217;s very\n",
      "out about his name &#8211; was at a summer camp and the guy, he was in a cabin with him, and the guy &#8211; and forgive me if this is X-rated &#8211; was encouraging them to do circle masturbation. He was shocked. He&#8217;s fourteen years old. He went to the pastors and told them this, this is a year before the arrest, and they decided not to believe him. They said he was exaggerating and that this seminary student &#8211; Doug Goodrich, he was in the news &#8211; that Doug said, \"Oh, it&#8217;s locker room humor. This is what we were doing and he&#8217;s exaggerating it.\" His parents came in and met with them and they ignored it and, not only then, but then he was actually put on probation for six weeks, the parents weren&#8217;t told, because he was taking them to some pretty explicit R-rated movies and a parent discovered it. So they told the church that he was taking a six-week sabbatical to help care of his sick mother but in fact it was due to that. He came back and he was escalating, and it was a policeman&#8211;. He took a kid after church to a park and was molesting him in a car and was found by a policeman, so we know that this all happened. I was in absolute shock, and I went to the pastors and I said, \"Why didn&#8217;t you do something a year ago? This is bad behavior.\" They denied that the meeting ever took place. They said, \"No, the kid didn&#8217;t report this.\" That&#8217;s when I realized something was wrong. The mother was a friend of mine, I knew her through the school and stuff, and I watched her as she talked to me, and I knew when she was telling me the story, and I was watching her hands shake, that I knew my life was about to change forever. I knew that I was stepping into something that I couldn&#8217;t come back from, but I didn&#8217;t know quite what it was. I called a friend who taught Sunday school with us and I said, \"You&#8217;re a deacon, you do something about it.\" He goes, \"Well, I thought it was all dealt with.\" I said, \"I&#8217;m sorry, you claim that you believe all this stuff in the Bible. You can&#8217;t let this go.\" He said that that was a moment that changed his life forever, that I held his feet to the fire. We got a group of people together and confronted the church. The church did an investigation and claimed that the meeting never took place and that they didn&#8217;t know anything about it, and we knew that it had taken place. We had people who remember when it all occurred and so forth. We left the church, and the Bible study that we founded with our Sunday school class, the day we walked out &#8211; we told the class we had to leave and we were very frank about it &#8211; that class was decimated, and our friends all went to different churches but we still get together twice a month for a Bible study. We&#8217;ve been together for years, and the young man gave me a gift that I will never forget because I believed him. I was at a party and he came up to me and said, \"I got this for you,\" and it was those little Willow Creek&#8211;. Have you seen those little angel carvings? They&#8217;re made of wood. You see them in the Hallmark stores. EF: Oh, yeah. DP: And it was the Angel of Courage, and her hands are raised like that, and he said, \"You gave up everything, your church, your Sunday school class, because you believed me.\" And he is a very, very healthy young man today but he was headed down a tough path. So I said, \"That&#8217;s it, I&#8217;m starting a blog. I&#8217;m going to start writing about a lot of things that have been troubling me for a long time,\" and my husband made me promise&#8211;. He said he wouldn&#8217;t do it again, but my husband and my friend&#8217;s husband were worried that we were going to get in trouble, we were going to get sued, and I can understand why they felt that way. So they asked us, in the incident that happened at that church, not to write about it directly, so we did a series called \"Leaving Wonderland\" and we wrote about what happened but gave names to the characters, like \"Alice\" and so forth. EF: Sure. DP: The church was mad at us, they actually got some lawyers, however Jeff Anderson, who is&#8211;. If you look him up on Wiki he&#8217;s the one responsible for most of the settlements against the Catholic Church. He heard about what we did and he called me, he called and talked to me on the phone, and he said, \"I just want to let you know, they can throw you out of the church but they can&#8217;t bring you to court. You&#8217;ve done nothing wrong. If you need me, I&#8217;ll fly in and tell them.\" So he then helped me to understand what I can say and what I can&#8217;t say. EF: Sure. DP: So we began writing, we wrote about that. Then Mark Driscoll&#8211;. EF: And this is the Wartburg Watch, right? DP: Yes, and we named it after the castle that they had Martin Luther in when the pope was trying to&#8211;. EF: And what year did you begin this? DP: 2009. EF: Okay. DP: And nobody read us at first, except for people affiliated with the church who wanted to see if they could get any dirt. EF: Right. DP: We were very careful about what we said. But we also didn&#8217;t like a lot of other people. Mark Driscoll was very famous, Mars Hill, and if you look at him, he just had to step down, but he was big. We wrote [about him and] we called it \"Brother Mark&#8217;s Traveling Sex Show.\" He came here to UNC campus and we wrote about&#8211;. I mean, he&#8217;s pretty gruesome, and I don&#8217;t&#8211;. It&#8217;s almost hard to talk about some of the things he said as well, about women, as really&#8211;. Well, I mean everyone&#8217;s written about it in the papers, in the New York Times. He called \"penis humps.\" EF: Wow. DP: Yeah. I mean this was stuff that was going on, and we couldn&#8217;t believe it because all of the Neo-Calvinist crowd, they were loving this Mark Driscoll who was into this manly stuff, and my friend and I, we&#8217;re no one. We&#8217;re just like average people. She has an MBA, by the way, from Carolina. We&#8217;re average people and we&#8217;re looking at everything we&#8217;re seeing, and we talked to some pastors at Southeastern, seminarians, and they&#8217;re saying, \"You don&#8217;t get it. We all support them and there&#8217;s something wrong with the two of you.\" Well, Mark Driscoll just stepped down, so maybe we weren&#8217;t so stupid after all. We&#8217;re average nobodies. So I said, \"Look, let&#8217;s get our thoughts out on the table. Let&#8217;s start writing.\" So the first year a few people trickled in. Well, we are still in absolute shock, because then people started sharing their stories. So we started posting their stories at this church and that church, and now, this morning, I had a little technical glitch and a guy in Perth, Australia said, \"I see your glitch. Here&#8217;s how you take care of it.\" I&#8217;ve got a guy in Perth, Australia, and there&#8217;s even a gal who works during the summer months in Antarctica who follows us, and we have people in England and Scotland who are regulars on our blog, and we continue to go after child sex abuse. This was a big deal for us and there are so&#8211;. Boz Tchividjian, who is Billy Graham&#8217;s grandson, he got into this too and he said that the evangelical church is in worse shape than the Catholic Church when it comes to child sex abuse, and he&#8217;s formed a group called GRACE which is exposing child sex abuse in the evangelical church. And he&#8217;s right, because if you look at the statistics you have like a billion adherents in the Catholic Church. If you look at it percentage wise we are higher than the Catholic Church when it comes to not handling child sex abuse, pedophilia, and so forth. EF: But Catholic abuses are much more in the media. DP: Yes, although it&#8217;s starting, because we now are&#8211;. We were very involved in exposing the Sovereign Grace Ministries sex abuse cover-up, which we believe is a cover-up, and it is probably the biggest lawsuit that has been brought against one entity within the evangelical population. We were writing about that right from the start as well. A group of families have brought lawsuits against Sovereign Grace Ministries and it&#8217;s going to be a long battle in the courts. \n",

      "This guy was the head of the whole thing and he was very entrenched in the Neo-Calvinist movement, C. J. Mahaney and Sovereign Grace. So Todd went into the bookstore and said, \"They&#8217;re pushing C. J. Mahaney&#8217;s books. I&#8217;ve met a couple of those kids who were abused. I know some of those families. We should not have this man&#8217;s books in our bookstore,\" and he told them, he said, \"I&#8217;m not going to become a member of the leadership until you get rid of these books. I can&#8217;t in good conscience support this. To me child sex abuse is a horrendous blot on the church,\" and they said no, and in fact they push&#8211;. They quote C. J. Mahaney a lot in the services. So he said, \"That&#8217;s it, I&#8217;m out of here. I&#8217;m not going to be a member of this church,\" except he signed a membership covenant, and this is something that we talk about at length. These membership covenants are actually legal.

      "Probably like everyone else, it&#8217;s funding. We&#8217;re focused right now on awareness and the advocacy piece and that&#8217;s not quite as tangible for people to think about. People want to think about how many kids did you read to and how many kids did you give transportation to and real hard concrete numbers as opposed to saying, well, what does it mean if we are presenting to the re-entry folks at public safety tomorrow or something that you might not be able to track the results from, at least not quite as direct as you can. Say we read to fifteen children last week or we did twenty tutoring session or whatever the particular situation is. So yeah, so the funding piece and [it] continues to be, it&#8217;s a tough topic, and I always think, \"What can we learn from some of the other tough topics?\" So what can we learn from domestic violence and child sexual abuse and cancer and death and divorce, some of those other really tough topics, some of which have a lot of political stuff around them and what did we learn from those topics, what can we continue to learn from them? And how can we apply them to issues around incarceration?\n",

      "Well I had moved to Fayetteville and had two children, and a woman that I had met through the church had been very active with the National Organization for Women. She was a minister's wife and so, of course, very non-threatening. I Sylvia Ray never really thought about it very much. And she invited me to a meeting and I immediately--I had been involved with another organization on the issue of child abuse--and I sort of immediately connected problems within families as somewhat going back to women's lack of education or power or ability to cope with issues.\n",

      "CR: Mm-kay. I think, probably--you know I certainly was very aware of stigma with battered women. The tremendous blame that they received just because they were battered women. Well, the stigma and the discrimination against women who use substances is, is terrible. As bad, or worse, where there is this great condemnation of her, and how she&#8217;s hurting her child, how she&#8217;s deserving of the bad things that happen to her because she shouldn&#8217;t be drinking. I mean, and there&#8217;s a long history, of course, showing, you know--when you see a woman drinking on the street, and, you know not in control of herself--of saying, you know, 'She deserves what she gets,&#8217; or 'She must be a prostitute,&#8217; or whatever it is. And then, of course when it involves an infant or a fetus, there&#8217;s this even greater condemnation, because motherhood is to be this sacred thing that only the worst women would, you know, not do as they should. So, I think that is the stigma that is really, really one we continue to fight again, and again, and again. So, part of our role was, has been, to outreach to all the people who might provide to her, and talk with them about what addiction is about what addiction is about for women. I mean, how they get involved in it, what keeps them in it, what are the things that prevent them from recovering, so that they have a much more empathetic understanding of what this is about. So that they&#8217;re not, they&#8217;re more willing to, give her a hand like they would someone else with a major problem, and--as opposed to judging her. And I can give you an example. We used to go to nurseries up in the hospitals, unnamed hospitals, and ask, you know, nurses, let&#8217;s say in the NICUs that--you know how did they feel about our patients, and women who had used and their babies were now in the NICU. Even if the mom&#8217;s use had nothing to do with why the baby was in the NICU. Well, I mean, they could say, you know, very clearly how angry they were at these women, and that it would translate into behaviors, like not welcoming her home when she came in. You know, like another woman, she might say, 'Oh, Mary, come over and see what Frankie&#8217;s doing today. And I want to show you this.&#8217; They wouldn&#8217;t necessarily do that, because they would assume she didn&#8217;t care, she shouldn&#8217;t have done what she did. It was a very punitive response, which we all understand because we all have some of those feelings, but when we&#8217;re professionals, you need to be aware of those feelings, and then make sure that you&#8217;re doing what your role is, which is to help this woman take a different road. Or they wouldn&#8217;t give her information, or necessarily share things with her that they would with a woman who was not using and a mother of her infant in the NICU. So, we know that people really need to look at some of their attitudes. And, and when you ask anyone, 'How do you feel about let&#8217;s say a eight-month-old pregnant woman, you know, smoking? You know, how do you feel?&#8217; We want people to talk about how they feel and what are their--what are they thinking when they see that. And, and, they become more aware of, 'Wow, they say she&#8217;s stupid, where she&#8217;s been, how ignorant can you be?&#8217; Or, you know, 'I can&#8217;t have a baby and here she gets to have a baby, and she can&#8217;t even, you know, take care of this baby.&#8217; That, that those are normal things that, in our culture, brought up in our culture, that we&#8217;re going to feel and think. But then we have to go beyond that if we&#8217;re going to be helpers for someone who&#8217;s making some changes in this area, to how we can be helpful to her, and to understand what&#8217;s going on with her that that&#8217;s what she&#8217;s doing. Now of course, as it turns out, and this is how the circle goes around, one of the primary issues for women in substance addictions is trauma. You know, they have been child sexual abuse survivors, rape victims, battering victims, and that&#8217;s a major way that women cope with trauma, and learn how to manage, PTSD symptoms is to, to zone out, you know, to numb out. And that&#8217;s a major piece of what&#8217;s going on for many of the women that we work with. So, I mean it was like really, for me, a circle coming around.\n",

      "CR: Well, why they create them is of course, one - a lot of it&#8217;s learned behavior. If they see their parents or people in their community deal with life and life&#8217;s problems by drinking, then, you know, like other behaviors, you know, that&#8217;s what they may decide to do, too. And, in fact, see it as normal, fine, okay, as long as you don&#8217;t do certain things. And then, though, if they become hooked, then really addicted to it, then they&#8217;ve got major problems. So it may be the learned behavior. And we can see that everywhere. When someone dies, someone says, 'Oh, give her a Valium, you know, so she can sleep tonight.&#8217; Or, 'she needs a stiff drink,&#8217; so she can manage those feelings. I mean, it&#8217;s a very common thing for us to do is to take a pill or a drug or alcohol as a way of dealing with an emotion that&#8217;s uncomfortable or painful. And, so there&#8217;s that culturally going on, and then if it&#8217;s happening in your homes, behaviorally, you see it and you have access to it, then you&#8217;re likely to use that as a way. Now, and you&#8217;ll see this with our women who have been sexually abused as children, when you ask them at what age they started taking alcohol or a drug, and you know, six, eight, ten. You know, what&#8217;s going on that a child would be doing that at that age? What&#8217;s happening in that family that they have, one, access to it, but that that is seen as something&#8217;s going on that they need that. So, a large part of it is that it&#8217;s how our society tends to cope with things, is through taking pills. And you know pills, now, is the major addiction we&#8217;re dealing with. Opiate addiction, now, is number one here. And it&#8217;s pills prescribed by doctors, you know, for pain, or for anxiety.\n",

They are intensely uncomfortable, for the most part, with how black women claim and redefine feminism for ourselves, and we intersect it. \n",

      "My mother was extremely repressed sexually and I did not understand why, but what was commonly known was that my brother, her last child, was born in 1955 and she stopped having sex with my father then and they still remained married until they both died. We didn&#8217;t properly understand why and as kids you don&#8217;t actually peek into your parents&#8217; sex life, but when I got the job at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center\"and therein is a story\"that&#8217;s when my mother felt that I was the child to entrust her history to. I had been there a couple of years before she opened up to me, just surprisingly on one phone call. She just said, \"Loretta, I&#8217;ve never told any of y&#8217;all this but I need to share this with you.\" I said that we were a farming family and one of the characteristics of a farming family is that multiple generations live in the same house, and so my mother had been sexually abused\"and her sisters, by the way\"by an uncle, and for my mother it happened from age eight to age sixteen when she got married to leave home, and that created a lot of sexual trauma in my mother that she never had any counseling for and healing from. The uncle ended up being in prison in a mental institution until he died, and even before my mother told me the story we got this notice saying Uncle Eli has died, and all the kids said, \"Who is Uncle Eli? How come we&#8217;ve never heard of Uncle Eli? We know Uncle Jim, we know Uncle Eskie, we know Booker T.; how come we don&#8217;t know about Uncle Eli? How did we miss this uncle?\" My mother said, \"Oh, he was one of Big Mama&#8217;s children,\" and that&#8217;s all she said about Uncle Eli, and nobody went to his funeral or anything. So Uncle Eli was like the big mystery but we weren&#8217;t curious enough to try to follow it up. Well it turns out Uncle Eli was the uncle that sexually abused all the girls in the family. So Mama never had a healthy relationship around sex and sexuality, and then when I became pregnant through incest, through a cousin, my mother went ballistic. She actually beat me for being pregnant. She was not healthy around sex and sexuality. I could never under\". And she did some really predictable but what seemed to be bizarre things at the time, like every time my father would take one of his daughters out\"and me and my father were particularly close so I hung out with Daddy all the time. I was Daddy&#8217;s girl. Daddy was the light of my life and I loved him to death. I know I was his favorite child and he knows he was my favorite parent, so there was no ambiguity at all about our relationship, but my mother would get so angry. I knew the minute I came home whatever I did it was not going to be right, and they believed in corporal punishment, so if I didn&#8217;t wash the dishes good enough that night I was going to get a whipping. It wasn&#8217;t until years later that I put together her fear around an adult male having a child outside of her eyes. My big sister told me, \"She did the same with me.\" She was just paranoid and it wasn&#8217;t until she told us her story, after we were already in our thirties [Laughs] that we were able to put all the pieces together, because what seemed to be craziness was actually PTSD. CGD: Were you able to tell your mother about the incest? LR: I had to. CGD: Was she able to hear it and process it? LR: [Pause] I&#8217;m not sure, because she got terribly re-stimulated by it. She had blamed herself for her own so she blamed me for mine. We actually agreed that I would go to a home for unwed mothers. CGD: How old were you? LR: Fourteen. CGD: Okay. So, I&#8217;m thinking about Rickie Solinger&#8217;s book about unwed mothers, of course later time period, and the argument is that basically in the &#8217;50s there are very few homes for black unwed mothers, so what was your experience? LR: It wasn&#8217;t a black home but I was the only black girl at the home. It was a home run by the Salvation Army in San Antonio, near Trinity University, over on the other side of town. The Salvation Army ran a number of these homes across America. A little bit more skirt to the story, I had already received a scholarship to Radcliffe and, trust me, having Melvin baby, was not how I planned on becoming a mama. I was not planning on being a mama. He was supposed to be babysitting me and he thought it was a better idea to have sex with me, and he was a serial abuser. That was one of the things that I really challenged within my family, how multigenerational the incest was, and yet we couldn&#8217;t talk about sex and sexuality, and I challenged that. The minute I became conscious of it I started introducing this very awkward conversation into our family. [Laughs] Whenever I see a young budding niece I go have a conversation with their mama, with my brother, whoever it was needed to have a conversation, and they would dread me coming, because I would say, \"You know what happened to me, you know what happened to Mama; we got to stop this in this generation here, okay? I don&#8217;t even know how far back it goes but I know it&#8217;s going to stop in this generation, and I will kill any of you that lay a hand on anybody and I find out about it.\"\n",

      "You know, I keep it\". Well even before I started talking about abortion and incest I was talking about sterilization abuse, which is acceptable, but I started talking about rape, which was not, in the black community. CGD: Why do you think that was not acceptable? LR: Because ninety-five percent of rapes are intra-racial. If I wanted to talk about rape as something white men did to black women I could have had the Ida B. Wells story, but talking about rape as something that black men do to black women, it&#8217;s airing dirty laundry. So long before I started publicly talking about abortion I was committing the social faux pas of talking about rape and incest in the black community as something black people did to ourselves. I mean I&#8217;ve gotten booed off black stages and stuff, I mean stages at black conferences and conventions. They always used to accuse us of selling out to the white women, and one guy called me\"he and his wife, [1:41:36], I&#8217;ll never forget them\"they accused me of being a representative of COINTELPRO because I was talking about this stuff and it wasn&#8217;t helping the black community, and so I had to be a plant by the FBI to destabilize the black movement. [Sighs; laughs] That was a pretty heavy charge, to accuse somebody of being COINTELPRO back in that day, because that set you up for somebody just taking you out of here, only because I was talking about gender oppression and they didn&#8217;t want to talk about it.\n",

      "This was 1968 that I went canoeing on a river with some friends, and other people left and I was waiting on a couple of people to come back with a canoe, and we didn&#8217;t really know where we were. But I met a family there and the man was being abusive to his three-year-old daughter, and I am sure it was clear on my face that I didn&#8217;t approve. She had hit him, and he had hit her, and then she had hit him. But he was hitting her until she had red splotches all over, and he had been drinking, and I could tell the mother was really upset. We were in a very remote picnic area. It was getting dark and the man offered to go up and let me look down and see if I could see my compatriots, and if I didn&#8217;t I was going to go back into - I was up near Cookville, Tennessee. Anyway, without the gory details, he ended up beating me up and raping me, and I was twenty one at the time. But the thing that has ended up about that experience is that I had never had a violent experience before, never been in a violent situation. My parents were very gentle people. Most of the people I knew were gentle people, so I had never come up against violence in that way. But what he kept saying-and he was almost in a trance-what he kept saying over and over again is that \"I have killed women and children in Vietnam and I can crack your neck with one hand.\" He just kept saying that over and over about Vietnam. He was a Vietnam vet. Later I commented to someone, they said, \"Who raped you?\" And I said, \"The war.\" Because I really came to see it that way. I didn&#8217;t prosecute because of my father&#8217;s health. I actually ended up knowing who he was because his wife had given me his business card, because she liked my dog, and she had no idea. I think she must have sensed that something happened, because I took him back and I was all beaten up, and I just let him out of the car and drove off. He had no idea that I had his business card in my pocket. I just could not do that to my parents. They would have never gotten a night&#8217;s rest about me. It was hard enough for them for me to be on my own. But that is what has haunted me about that period of time. So I am very sensitive about violence towards women, sexual violence, but I am also sensitive about what wars do to people. I think if women made those decisions, as they do in some Native American cultures-in the Cherokee culture, it is the women who tell the men whether to go to war or not-I don&#8217;t think women would kill each other&#8217;s children quite so hastily. I just think that it is a sad situation that our world, and that our particular society in America, does not have as part of the tightest threads of its fabric the wisdom of women. That they don&#8217;t take it seriously.\n",

      "BEAL: In 1998, a number of black people from around the country had become concerned with the Million Man March, the attack on Anita, um ... ROSS: Hill. BEAL: ... Hill, around the ... it was really a bad attack on her. ROSS: Clarence Thomas. BEAL: Yeah. And it was around the Clarence Thomas nomination. And it threw right back into the black movement of all stripes, How are you going to deal with these questions of women's oppression and exploitation in the context of, you've got, you know, an anti-racist struggle going on. And more than anything else, I think that if black people are suffering today from the rulings of Clarence Thomas ... and they are ... a lot of it has to do with their refusal to take up Anita Hill's exposure of him as a sexual abuser. And had they taken that a little bit more seriously, they would recognize that black faces in high places is not something that's going to resolve the problems that black women are facing today, nor that other people of color are facing today. So I think that was a lesson for some people. Then again, it had an impact on a number of people feeling there needed to be a more progressive black voice in the country\n",

      "But here in D.C., one of the larger churches and the minister was accused of sexual harassment. And there were four women, and they were really, really upset and traumatized. And they were directed to, not just the Rape Crisis Center, they were directed to me, to work with them and support them and sit in on some of their meetings and so forth and so on. And this guy was actually charged, you know, with sexual harassment. And in the church, he ultimately, even though it was kind of close, but he ultimately won. Oh, no, not ... you know. In the process, though, working with these women was just really ... it was horrendous. And because the case was in the newspaper and that sort of thing. I was getting criticized, you know, for bringing down a good man, for messing with somebody's reputation or getting into the middle of something that wasn't that serious. It's not like he raped anybody, that sort of thing. And I can clearly remember one day, I was ... two particular occasions. One, there was a man and woman together somewhere up in Northwest, and he said, \"Aren't you the woman at the Rape Crisis Center that's working with the women?\" \"Yes, I am.\" \"How are you going to just tear a black man down?\" Kind of went into this, right? And the woman, the sister who was with him, she kind of pulled him up, you know, she was kind of, like, Why don't you leave her alone? She's ... we're out here doing, to go to the movies. Why are you doing this? kind of thing. Which was the first time that I sort of realized, my goodness, this is kind of bigger than I realized it was. And then, I was walking across Malcolm X Park, and this guy says, \"Aren't you the woman who's helping those women against John?\" His first name was John, I cannot remember his last name. I could go back and look this stuff up because I know I have it somewhere. And I said, \"Yes.\" And he said, \"Well, what's wrong with you? Do you like men?\" And I said, \"No.\" And he said, \"Oh, because you're a lesbian.\" What I really meant was I don't like men like you, you know, small-minded and aggressive and rude. So, he said, \"You're a lesbian.\" And so I just said something like, \"You'd better watch your girlfriend,\" because he just pissed me off. I don't know.

That was an insult for a white man to say he wanted you, that was an insult, you see.\n",

      "AM: I had about eight, you know, from the different marriages. And he married my mother... My father's father was a white man. His mother had been raped, you see, on the plantation, And so he was the son of a white man. CG: Now what was his name? AM: My father was St. Cyr Moore. Father was a very handsome man, about six feet tall, and broad shouldered, very powerful man, powerfully built, very good looking, extremely good looking. And I understood that he married my mother more out of spite than anything else. His second wife was one of those...they call them octoroons in New Orleans. That is, you couldn't tell her from white. Obviously the daughter of a lot of raping in that family. And my mother was your complexion, and this was supposed to have been a cardinal sin, for a man of his complexion to marry a brown woman. And so the prejudice was very high against color in the South. The light-skinned people felt that they were superior to the black-skinned people, and this was taught to us, it was taught. Everything that happened in your life was to demean the original people, the African complexion. And the ones who was mixed with the white blood was better. It's a terrible scourge; that was, again, an injury against us. They added insult to the injury; after raping us, then teaching us that we were better than the black ones that had escaped the rape, you see? So this always had somewhat an effect on me. When Marcus Garvey came on the scene, then of course a deep consciousness was awakened in me. And I recall the lynching; my grandfather was lynched. CG: Ah. Your father's father or your mother's father? AM: My mother's father was lynched. My grandmother's husband was lynched and... CG: Now was this the grandmother that you went to stay with?Ã¯Â»Â¿5 AM: Yes, that was Grandma, and you couldn't tell her from a white woman to save your life, which shows all the rape that went on in our family. You know, I mean with our people. CG: And he was lynched? AM: Yes. He was a black man, he was very black, and he was lynched for standing up to some white people who wanted his land. This was all it amounted to, because after he was lynched they ran my grandmother off the land, and she had to take her five little children and flee for her life with the things they had on their back, nothing else, leave everything, their cattle, they had cattle and everything on her farm. So all of her children, Grandma had to place them with white people. Now white people in those days, the French whites, they had a custom of having a little black child in the home to play with their little children. I mean people who don't see the prejudice against black people today can't understand this, that they would rather have a black child play with their children than for their children to socialize with the little white child who was lower in rank than them, you see?\n",

They were burned beyond recognition, and they said the body was a body of Jesse Dawt's brother, a colored man that attempted rape on a white girl. TD: That was in the city... EMS: Vicksburg, Mississippi. TD: About how old were you then when you saw that?... EMS: I was seven or eight years old. We dare not to talk about it, we dare not to say anything, it was just there, what the gasoline... TD: As a child, if you were seven years old, somebody must have told you. EMS: My father, my mother's husband told me, I think it was. TD: Told you that...he identified these charred bodies and the fact that... EMS: Well, the people were talking... TD: Attempted rape...a seven-year-old child does not necessarily know what attempted rape would be. EMS: No. Because I doubt it seriously if they used the word rape back in them days. TD: What word did they use? EMS: I think they used the word that they insulted a white girl. TD: I see. He insulted a white...insulting is a little different from rape. EMS: I know, but he asked the question and insulted her, and we knew what that meant, because we didn't know the word pregnancy, what that meant. They were just saying that the girl had broke her leg, and I was so dumb, I looked to see was her leg broke. But her leg wasn't broke, but her stomach was setting out and that is the way, the language they used to us children\n",

      "My mother was champion for all. The principal of our grade school could look out from her third floor, which is the Edmund Meany Junior High now, but was... CAT: (cont.) Longfellow Grade School...from the top floor, I'd say three floors up...from her little cubicle at the top, she could look down and see my mother marching to school, and she knew that some child there of color had been called a name or been slapped, or had been insulted, and my mother was on her way there to defend this child. Not her own children, although she had to defend us, but any child who had problems. The same thing at Garfield High School. Any literature that was taught that was derogatory to blacks, she was up there, and that literature was taken out of the schools. MMG: These were materials used in the classroom. CAT: Materials used in the classrooms, like the poem, \"Study of the Negro Race\"... \"fat black bucks in the wine barrel room \"you know that one. She had her eye on the schools all the time. She was fighting for young people. For example, a boy was accused of rape. Mother had intended to be a lawyer, and one of the write-ups that we have of her with her picture in a book, is that she intended to be a lawyer...of course, she met Mr. Pitter and Mr. Pitter married her instead, and she was supposed to go ahead and be a lawyer, but I came along. This young fellow, for example, was accused of rape, and Mother went out into the area, and because of her color, and Mother had bright red hair and green eyes, and after typhoid, her hair was light brown. And so, Caucasians would not always know people who were black. She could go out as she could find out many things. She found out from the neighbors what type of people these parents of the girl were. She defended this young man and other young people as well to keep them out of prisons, because we didn't have any juvenile homes in those days. And because of her they went to reformatories instead. I have been told that if I could have heard her in court, that she could defend as well as any lawyer. MMG: Do you remember about the time period for this rape case? CAT: Let's see, this would have been in the mid-thirties, during high school. MMG: And this was carried in all the papers? CAT: In all the papers, yes. MMG: And what was the outcome of the case? CAT: The young boy was sent to reformatory school. There were others, too... not rape but, for example, a young fellow was picked up and he was six-foot five, or seven, something like that, for being a burglar, and Mother went down and proved how ridiculous the police were, after they described how the burglary was done, that a six-foot seven young man couldn't possibly have been the burglar. She was always doing this sort of thing. When a young man, a Caucasian, was murdered and raped here in the city jail, the mayor asked Mother to please be on the committee to help to plan the juvenile court. She accepted and she helped to plan the court that we have now. MMG: About what time was that, do you know?... CAT: This would be in the mid-forties. \n",

Tulsa, Oklahoma was a thriving community. They called it the Black Wall Street, people were doing extremely well, there was a lot of white resentment, they burned the town down to the ground, you know.

It's like a--it's like somebody who is a rape victim or incest victim, unless they actually cleanse themselves and acknowledge it and cleanse themselves the pathology comes out in other ways.

      "Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is all your father's mother or, or-- Speaker 2: My father's mother. Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Speaker 2: My father--so he would say her hair was long enough for her to sit on and it was not a curl in her hair. And so again he would say she was whiter than any white woman that you ever meet. Her husband, my grandfather William Henry James [William James], was very dark complected which obviously gave birth to my uncles. My father was the second of four boys in the family. But back to my grandmother, it really wasn't until years later--I was a college student at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] when my father's younger brother Uncle Hilton, Hilton James--he was pastor of Berean Baptist Church in Brooklyn, New York. They're a prominent congregation in New York [New York]. Anyway, Uncle Hilton was at Hampton--Uncle Hilton attended Hampton and was very proud of the fact that I was matriculatin\n",
      " at Hampton at that time. And he was visiting and we were--he was telling me about his mother--and because I said daddy said that--that--gave--talked about her attributes being so fair skinned and he said, \"Our mother wasn't fair skinned. Our mother was white.\" And I said well what's going on with that. He said that back in--I would assume Fluvanna County, because that's where she was born, my grandmother. They were three little white girls and they were raised by a woman that was very, very dark complected, Grandma Johnson [ph.] was their mother. But there was really no way that--and I'm using Uncle Hilton's words now that she--Grandma Johnson could've given birth to those three little white looking girls. So--but Grandma Johnson worked for a family in Virginia and she lived out in the back, and apparently this--someone in the family--a woman in the family or it could've been a couple of them had babies out of wedlock, had white babies--this is not miscegenation, this is not, you know, rape or incest, this is just someone who had babies out of--white babies out of wedlock. And in those days you lived up to the country like they lived. Every time this woman had a baby or one of these--it could've been sisters, it could've been just one whatever it wasn't clear. But every time there was--yeah at that time say illegitimate baby born, they would really in what essence toss the baby to the back yard to Grandma Johnson to raise. So, in essence, my grand- great-grandmother was raising these three little white girls for this family until circumstances occurred and Grandma Johnson relocated to Richmond with these three little girls. And one of those girls was my grandmother, Annie Carlisle [ph.] her--it was pronounced (pronunciation) Carlisle but it was Carlisle, is how you would spell it, Johnson James [Annie James] and Aunt Edna [ph.], who I did meet. I never met my grandmother but I did meet Aunt Edna. So I--if those kinds of stories are painful especially for people at that time--my father was very upset that my uncle shared that with me because I think he was more upset because of the fact that she'd be viewed as an illegitimate. I mean those days oh my god it was like--it was just such an insult. And he preferred to really think about my mother [sic.]--my father did, just during the time that she was, you know, married to his father and then raising them. Speaker 1: That's interesting. Yeah. We have a lot of stories that are not told (simultaneous). Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm sure. Speaker 1: But when they're told things make a whole lot more sense. \n",

      "Speaker 1: So, you were covering sit-ins and you called Percy Sutton and what happened? Speaker 2: Yeah. I, I called Percy Sutton to simply just ask him could I join and go down with the group, but he said, \"No we don't want any coverage you know, you don't need to go.\" So, I went of course. So, it was so ugly. It was so--the minute I got to this diner. It was a diner, this diner refused to serve blacks, so three men were behind the counter. \"Y'all can't sit here, we don't serve niggers.\" So, it, it, it's, it's still shakes you up. You, you hear about it, you read about, but every time it happens it shakes you up again and say I can't believe what I'm hearing. I can't believe this is now, this is today. I can't believe this kind of hatred exists. All of this goes through your mind, but here it is these terrible people. They knew in advance, of course, that the, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] leaders are coming down there. They didn't know a female reporter was going to be there, so I'm sitting there and I'm really frightened 'cause I'm seeing maybe for the first time the worse kind of hatred and anger and, and possible killing. I'm seeing this vividly, vividly, just by the language, the way they insulted, the things they said and how they said, the men behind the counter of the diner, which was--to these NAACP leaders, who were trying to be served. They, of course, the leaders all anticipated this. This was all done on purpose. They wanted to be arrested. They indicated a little surprise at me being there. They--I was not known as an NAACP leader and it soon, and they soon realized that I was a reporter and so they said awful dirty things to me very loudly. And we're all sitting there, these, these insults are going back and forth, but we are waiting for the police to arrive that's why we're just there to arrest all of us. That was, that's the idea. Speaker 1: You included? Speaker 2: Yeah. Except when they came to arrest everybody, one of the policeman reminded another policeman that the law, I believe, he said says that when a woman is arrested she must be arrested by a woman cop, which may or may not be true. I'm inclined to believe it is, it was true because what advantage would it be for leaving me there. But, they arrested the men and I was left there with these terrible men behind the counter. I think there were five of them shouting insults to me that I cannot even repeat. I, I've never been that frightened in my life. I, I was, and, and I'm wondering if they're gonna rape me, 'cause that was suggested as part of the insults they were throwing at me. I said are these four men gonna rape me? Are they gonna kill me, or is, is this woman police person whose gonna arrest me is she really gonna come? And I prayed quietly. I didn't, I, I just prayed quietly, and, and was so frightened wondering could I withstand what I thought was gonna happen to me, could I try to kill myself. It, it was not anger that I had it was just plain fear, just plain fear, the worse kind of fear. Story_ID: 372504 Speaker 1: The woman cop came sooner than I had expected, thank God. Her name was Ms. Kennedy [ph.], Officer Kennedy. She handcuffed me, took me to the car, took me to jail, and put me in there. In those--I, I, I don't know if it was five minutes or ten minutes or fifteen minutes that I just, I just had to sit there and hear all these insults being hurl, hurled at me and wondering---I really, I really was wishing for a way I could kill myself because I was thinking the worse kind of things, but none of that happened. God intervened and going to jail was a piece of cake you know, it was heaven (laughter). And they, we had a trial the next day. Speaker 2: Did you have to stay overnight in jail? Speaker 1: Um-hm. Speaker 2: We're you the only female? Speaker 1: Huh? Speaker 2: You were the only woman. Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: Were you-- Speaker 1: I just stood up all night in some little jail. Speaker 2: So you had a trial the next day, okay (simultaneous). Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because that whole thing was at night. I don't think it was a long night. The sit-in had started at night, so I, I don't think it was a long night. I do know I just stood, stood there and held onto the rails and had the trial the next day which lasted about five minutes and we were all found guilty and fined a hundred dollars each. Speaker 2: What was the paper's [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] response? Speaker 1: Hm? Speaker 2: What was the newspaper's response to your being arrested and fined one hundred dollars? Speaker 1: They just did a straight story on it. I didn't want it dramatized or anything. I, I, with me I, I don't, I don't, I, I wanted, I didn't get killed, I didn't get raped, the worse did not happen. With me I thank God and we don't need to dwell on my personal fears.

This special section was, you know, completed per se, and this photo essay that I, you know, had been working on, you know. And Ralph [Earl] Graves came in to look, to review it. And he's walking down, walking along the wall. And the editor is explaining--and then they come to the photograph of Eldridge Cleaver. Graves went ballistic. \"We're not having a convicted rapist in Life Magazine. You know, \"How dare you?\" Blah, blah, you know. \"He's nobody's leader, he's no new spokesperson.\" Blah, blah. \"He's a convicted rapist\", or whatever, you know. And the next thing I know, everybody is looking at me. The editor's looking at me. It's like it was if I was the only one who thought that, you know, Cleaver should be part of it. And I finally said, \"Look, I don't like that he's a convicted rapist. So, that does not necessarily mean that therefore he is not a spokesperson or a leader.\" You know, I said, \"We have had leaders of nations who have done worse\", you know. \"And it is not up to you to tell black people who they should follow. That's not who you, that's not your place either, Mr. Graves\", you know. \"And there are a lot of black people in this country who consider him to be a legitimate voice for their concerns. I thought he was going to have an apoplectic fit. And then he, you know, he yelled some more. And I said, \"Look, Dr. Franklin, John Hope Franklin, was supposed to be the advisor on this, this thing that they were doing.\" I said, I said, \"So, why don't you ask, speak to Dr. Franklin? You know, who am I? I'm a nobody. Ask Dr. Franklin, you know, what his opinion is.\" And I remember Graves stormed out of the room or whatever. The editor I remember said to me, \"Well, dear, you know, if you had thought that maybe there was going to be a job for you at Life Magazine, I think you can forget it.\" It was true. You know, I thought that I was really was going to get to be a reporter there. But after that incident, I knew I was mud. The upshot was Graves talked to Dr. Franklin, and Dr. Franklin told him almost essentially what I'd said.

      "Speaker 1: But there are many things that went on at the Georgia State Prison [Reidsville, Georgia]. I'll just give you an example of the, the cruelty of the, the place, the shocking cruelty. There was, the, they have classification systems in prisons. And the classification system by type of crime, violent, those kinds of characteristics. The Georgia State Prison had a policy of placing the young inmates, the first offenders, in with the homosexuals, because they said they didn't fight as hard as the older prisoners, and it was a way of pacifying the population. So I got, this is outrageous, I got a letter one time, an anonymous letter from someone who said there was a young inmate who had been viciously gang raped in the dormitory and that this inmate was writing to say couldn't we help to try to get this kid out. So I called for the--an opportunity to meet this young man, and he came out, and he was not as big as I am, he looked like he didn't shave yet, little young, in for car theft, first offender. He was obviously, mentally, completely out of it. I mean he couldn't, he was having hallucinations because every time I talked to him he was doing this, looking around, he was hearing voices. I talked to him for about an hour, trying to get him to say anything. The only thing that he said, I said, \"If I could get you out of here, where would you want to go?\" And he finally said, \"Home.\" So I wrote on a yellow pad a temporary restraining order application, I served it on the warden, and then I appealed to him as a human being. I said, \"Look, you know, we can go and try to torture the judge into having a hearing, and, and do all this and get the lawyers involved.\" I said, \"But surely you don't want a young man just to be viciously gang raped over and over again in your institution, under your own humanity. Won't you please move him?\" And so they moved him, but listen to what happened. They moved him from the open ward, where he had been victimized, to the hospital floor, and they locked him in a cell so that nobody could get to him. Now this is inhumane for somebody who's mentally deranged and, and needs help, but he's at least protected from people being able to get to him, so I thought. I learned about a week later when I came back to the prison, that at night the inmate orderlies had the keys to the cells, and that they had victimized this young man while he was up there in the hospital floor for his own protection. Now to me--we later got him sent to a mental hospital. And I hope that they were able to do something to restore him to sanity. But to me, that is a classic example of the kind of vicious inhumanity and disregard for people. And any system that would treat young people that way, or have a classification system like that, is an abomination. Story_ID: 611913 Speaker 1: So when we hear things about prisons and conditions in them, it may be to say, well, there are a lot of bad guys, there are a lot of bad guys, I've met a lot of them. But there's so much more than that that is at issue and at stake, and it's--not only the treatment of individuals, it's the kind of society we insist up on having and we've got to fight back and push back because look at, look at what this is doing to black people, the increasing numbers of women, the disproportionate impact on our young men. It's, it's a vicious, vicious system. So that's one example of the kind of suffering that I saw. Here's another minor example, because I had just, I've, unfortunately a mind full of these stories, which is a terrible thing to carry around in your head to remember them. But I went and talked to, because there was an outbreak of tuberculosis and so we had filed to try to force the prison [Georgia State Prison, Reidsville, Georgia] to test everybody to see did these inmates have tuberculosis. There was one very handsome, tall, young brother whose name was Eugene X [ph.], he was a Muslim, and he was found with tuberculosis. And he had been coughing and hacking, he looked so pitiful and frail when I first met him, and they did get him some treatment. A couple of weeks later, I was talking to another inmate and I said, \"Well, you know, at least they got Mr. Barber [ph.] some care for his tuberculosis, and everybody has been tested, and so I feel better about that.\" And he looked me in the eye, he said, \"What?\" He said, \"I was his cellmate for a year, they never tested me.\" So you see the indifference with which human beings lives and wellbeing. I don't think that we put these people in prison so they can develop tuberculosis or be gang raped. It's, it's, they may have done things that were wrong but there's vicious cruelty. Story_ID: 611914 Speaker 1: Now my life, I think, was saved by a death row prisoner. This is an interesting tidbit. This is a white man. His name was Troy [Leon] Gregg. He was one of the lead plaintiffs in a case called Gregg versus Georgia [Gregg v. Georgia, 1976], in which the death penalty was upheld with standards, and this must have been in 1976. Troy Gregg was on death row at the Georgia State Prison [Reidsville, Georgia]. He was in there, I think because of felony murder situation. Meaning that he, that he and somebody else had robbed, the other person killed whoever it was, but Gregg was held equally liable for the death as the one who pulled the trigger, and so he also got the death sentence. He was a poor, low income guy, lived in a trailer, and sort of fit the stereotype of the, the poor southern white. But he was willing to testify about the harassment and treatment of black inmates on death row, and also about the conditions of confinement under which he suffered. I'll skip to the chase. On the day before a hearing that we were going to have on conditions of confinement and death row, I had insisted to the judge that the death row prisoners be transferred from the prison to the courthouse in, in order to have the hearing, that it was inherently coercive to have this hearing at the prison, and that they, like everyone else, should be brought to the court. And the court had ruled with me, although the defendants sorely objected. So we had the hearing. And but, before the hearing, Troy Gregg told me he said, \"Listen, Lynn [HistoryMaker Lynn Jones Huntley],\" he said, \"I know that they're planning to take the death row prisoners to the courthouse--to Tattnall County [Georgia] courthouse.\" I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Well, I'm going to tell you something that could get me killed if it got out,\" he said, \"But you seem like a nice person, and I know you're just trying to help us.\" And I said, \"Really, what is it?\" He said, \"Don't take the death sentence prisoners to Tattnall County.\" He said, \"Something is going to jump off, and you could be really hurt.\" And so I took his advice, I went back to the court, said I changed my mind in view of their delays and blah, blah, I would have the hearing for the death sentence prisoners at the Georgia State Prison. Fast forward it's now four years later, I'm working in the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] in Washington [D.C.] again in a trial section involving prison and jail litigation. I'm reading Corrections [Today] magazine one night, and there is an article: Troy Gregg and two other inmates had escaped from prison, from death row, and he was found murdered and drowned in a pond not too far from the prison. Now I don't know whether he was part of a conspiracy to escape at that time or not, but something tells me that when he told me that that's exactly what he was doing. That he knew, although he was under sentence of death, or life in prison, will never get out, that he saw something in me as a person and his humanity was touched, and he told me the word that perhaps had kept me from being in harm's way. So that shows you the complexity of doing this work. These are human beings and they have faces and voices and handwritings and names and not all of them are the, the vicious animals that we are portraying them to be. Many are people who have simply gone the wrong way, and it's a vicious system. \n",

And that's really--the kids in the juvenile justice system, I'm gonna tell you a story about the juvenile justice system and the link to the child welfare system. So, a young woman--and this is a young story that's not about a particular girl but it could be about lots of girls in the child welfare system and in the juvenile justice system. So, most of the children who are physically or sexually abused are abused by some man that they know, you know, the mother's boyfriend, the uncle, the cousin, whatever. So, a, a girl is abused, sexually abused and is taken away, put into the child welfare system, put into a foster home, runs away from the foster home, wants to be home still, wants--you know, runs away from the foster home, runs away again, is put in another one, runs away again, ultimately ends up on the street. What do you think she does to keep herself alive? Speaker 2: Prostitution, yeah. Speaker 1: What she was taught, right? Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 1: So, when she's picked up for prostitution, no one ever looks back and says, how did this child really get here? What's the trauma in her life, you know?

And so that's, to me, the number of kids that are in that situation in this country that we don't know about, we don't talk about, we don't care about is I think just outrageous.

Rosary Hill was, as I said, in the suburbs, and there was no transportation. The buses ran, but they stopped at a certain hour. Buses didn't even run, I don't think, on the weekends. So the college culture in Buffalo ... not just at Rosary Hill, and probably in the United States, I would imagine ... was you hitchhiked. I remember hitchhiking from Buffalo to Albany to go see somebody. You know, we were hitchhiking together. My first years, before I moved off campus, I had a job off campus, and I would hitchhike to that job, and once a guy exposed himself. I used to carry a knife actually, but I don't know what I thought I was going to do with it. ANDERSON: But you still didn't think you were gay? (laughter) ACEY: It had a nice little leather holder. ANDERSON: Yes, I was going to say. ACEY: I forgot about that too. God, you know, the things that come back to you are amazing. So it was a culture of hitchhiking, and people were careful. I eventually stopped hitchhiking by myself. I didn't think it was such a cool, you know ... But sometimes you just got desperate though, you had to get someplace. Nobody had the money to have cabs, and it wasn't like New York where you just, you know, put your hand out. My sister and her roommate were going out for the evening to a bar, and they left campus and they hitchhiked. They got picked up by two guys, who drove them near where they were going, but pulled into the driveway at the state hospital, which is this big ... massive acres and trees and deserted and dark ... you know, long driveway. My sister and her roommate were in the back seat of a two-door car, and when they went to let them out, her roommate got out, they pushed her, and they drove off. Her roommate got hysterical and called the police when she got somewhere ... I can't remember ... and got some help. I worked my way through college. I mean, I had some scholarships and my parents helped me, but I always held down a job. I don't know how I did that. I used to take a lot of classes, be involved in politics, and work. I just don't know how that all happened but it did. I was probably a crazy person then too. ANDERSON: Yeah, it was the pace that you set a long time ago that you still have. ACEY: I was running the student union that night and there was a dance. I got a call to come to the police station. I was with these close women friends, and I didn't have a jacket, it was chilly. My friend gave me her leather jacket and said, \"Wear this.\" And I went off, and I got to the police station and found out what had happened to my sister. She'd been beaten and raped. She'd been found in a park. There was an alert out, that she was in a park that was closed, with these guys, and the police were just doing a routine run-by of the park, and they saw this car and they investigated. So my sister was traumatized. There was a woman police officer talking to her and then to me. The guys who had done this were African American, and the police were saying some really outrageous ... So it was this, really, another one of those conflict-ridden, contradictory situations where both she, who is, like, bruised and beaten ... She was a virgin. She might have been a sophomore or a freshman. I don't know, (inaudible) personal history, anyway. So we got into an argument with the police officer, who had begun to make some racist statements, and I made the comment that, \"How can you say this? I was with friends, this jacket belongs to my friend.\" So I just said to them, \"Let's just leave this, let's just get out,\" because she had to get to the hospital, get all these tests. We're talking late '60s, maybe 1970s. I can't remember if I was of legal age, because I am a year older, but we basically didn't want my parents to know what happened to my sister, because we felt it would kill them, knowing that she'd been raped and brutally beaten. To this day we don't know. There were all kinds of knives and axes in the car, so we don't know if they intended to kill ... ANDERSON: So you were trying to protect your parents from the pain of that. ACEY: We were trying to protect my parents, which was, you know, probably the very wrong thing to do. And then within days, my mother and my aunt were coming to visit, and now this became a big thing. There was a big newspaper article that someone had been raped from campus. Nobody knew, so there was all this buzz on the campus. My sister is not in a great shape, we're trying to keep this from our parents. My aunt and mother arrive, and we go out and do something and we come back to my sister's room, and she's on the phone sobbing. What the police had done is to call my father and told him that his daughter was brutally beaten and raped, and his other daughter ... they made up some kind of story, and I can't remember. Again, I'd have to ask my sister exactly how it went, but they got in that his other daughter ... they got in the leather jacket and all that, but they kind of made it something else. ANDERSON: And African American friends too. ACEY: Yeah, they kind of made it an ugly story rather than how it was. So then here we are, my mother and Anna want to know what's happened and why was my sister crying. So that was like completely ... And Joanne, well, she had to go through three trials. She already had left Buffalo and gone off to graduate school, and they were flying her back. I think the first trial was a hung jury, and the second trial they were convicted, but then they got off on a technicality, an appeal. And then there was a third trial, at which they were, in fact, convicted. One, I think, ended up serving a few months, the other a year. So, ah, it was, you know, a big thing. I think I went through a lot of denial, you know? ANDERSON: Yeah. ACEY: A number of years later, I began to be more in touch with the feelings about it. Now I ... you know, fast forward ... I have become involved in the women's movement, through reproductive rights and sterilization abuse work, and then anti-sterilization abuse, and also antiviolence, women's antiviolence work, mostly around sexual assault and rape, but also somewhat around battered women. They were different organizations at that time, but the women who were doing the antiviolence work were very connected. Some are involved in both. So it was years later that I got more connected to what had happened, because I think I went into a very ... denial: [it] happened, [it's] over. You know, I felt like my sister needed to get some help. Initially she did a little counseling, but she really never, I don't feel ... The resources weren't there. She was treated terribly by the defense attorneys, treated terribly by the medical folks. There was no one place that I feel she got what she needed, and I think even from me. My parents were devastated, but again, there wasn't a lot of discussion about it. So years later I got more in touch with what had happened, kind\n",
      "of the hugeness of it. ANDERSON: Through the movement or through other personal work or therapy? ACEY: In working within the women's antiviolence movement. By the time I got involved with it, there were many lesbians, women of color. It was about organizing and advocacy but also services, but it was also about personal. So the more exposed I got to people working, but also women who had experienced some violence, the closer it got me to, like, begin to get better in touch and to begin to take in that experience in a whole different way. I remember distinctly one conference where there was a session that was women of color only, to talk personally. The opening question was, We're going to go around the room, and I want each person to ... if they can ... relate an experience of their own or of someone close to them or one they know. I remember there might have been about 40 women in the room. Every single woman had a story, and I was totally overwhelmed by it. Again, this is years later. We're maybe talking at least ten years later, if not more ... probably more ... since my sister's rape. I just remember just sobbing and sobbing, and then I started to talk a little more to my sister. Well, now we're talking, you know, well over 30 years ago. It still feels like it didn't get completely processed, if you will, so. \n",

      "And I think I clearly see that when I wanted to send my children to the school I'd gone to, and my husband and I believed in public education, and I went down to the local school, I saw that it was not going to be possible for me to send our children to that school. So I would either have to do something about it, or find a private school for them to go to. I think the saddest day was when I felt I had to take my children out of public school, and that was because a seven-year-old little girl was raped at the lunch hour, and she came into the school office and said, \"A man was playing with my pussy.\" And she had blood streaming down her legs, and she was crying. And the school principal, who was a woman of color, told her to sit down on the bench, went into the office, shut the door, and talked to the Board of Education legal department to see what her legal liability was in the case of this child. Nobody hugged that child. Nobody cleaned that child up. Nobody called that child's mother. Nobody called the police. They left that child for one hour sitting on the bench crying, and letting the blood keep down her legs. It was not until the next morning, when I had brought my children to school, and my husband was home sick, and I was standing in front of the school chitchatting with a few of the other parents. Somebody ... who I promised I would never divulge who it was, somebody said to me, \"You don't know what happened in the school yesterday, but you'd better find out quick. Let me tell you, a child was raped,\" and proceeded to tell me, and said, \"You'd better do something about it because nothing is being done about it in the school.\" So I said, \"Well, what are you doing about it?\" Well, of course he kept walking down the street when I said that. So I talked to the parents, and I said, \"We've got to do something. This is what happened.\" And everybody was outraged. But I realized what this little girl must have gone through. Nobody hugged her and said, That man was wrong; you didn't do anything wrong. This school principal convinced the mother to take her out of the school. And I realized how young women are not treated in a respectful way for what their feelings are or what happens. Now this was only one case, but as we were standing out there talking, a car came cruising along, and it was the local community relations policeman, and he was this wonderful Irish guy. He got out of his car, and he said, \"Well, Suki, what are you doing standing out here?\" I said, \"You know damn well what I'm doing out here. I'm telling the other parents what I've just heard about wha\n",
      " was going on in the school yesterday.\" So he said, \"Oh, you heard?\" I said, \"Yes, I heard.\" He said, \"That bitch!\" And I said, \"Excuse me?\" He said, \"She could have called us. The kid gave such a description of that man, we could have picked him up in no time because the kid gave such a good description of what the man looked like and what the man had on and what he smelled like.\" He said, \"We're furious.\" I said, \"If you're so mad, would you, please ... you're in plain clothes ... would you please go walking around the school and see who stops you, and check all the doors, see if they're all locked.\" So he said, \"Well, you know, they have to be able to open them from the inside out.\" I said, \"Yeah, but I want to know if they're locked from the outside so the guy can't get in. He got in somehow.\" So he went around, and he said, \"Nobody stopped me. Half the people don't know who I am. Some of the people know who I am.\" Some of the administration knew him, but the average teacher didn't know him. He said, \"Nobody stopped me.\" Now this was the day after a very serious issue. So the parents ... we got together, and we said, Well, we're going to have to stop everybody from going in the school. We discussed, What are we going to do? Finally we decided, Okay, we're going to have armbands on all the teachers, and we're going to tell the children they may not talk to anybody who doesn't have an armband on. And if somebody doesn't have an armband on, they should tell their teacher they saw somebody and give a description. And nobody can come in the building unless they agree to have an armband put on. Well, you know, you'd think this would be a perfectly reasonable solution. There were teachers who refused to put an armband on. \"I'm not going to wear something like that.\" Well now, if it had been their child that was raped, wouldn't they want to do something? We couldn't think of anything to do without disrupting the educational program, but we thought this would be perfectly simple. Teach the kids somebody was hurt in the school and not everybody in the school should be in the school. So I learned about the stereotypes of ... A teacher doesn't necessarily care about the children she's teaching; a teacher doesn't necessarily care about the issue. And so we ended up having to go to court because a few teachers pushed, shoved, accused us of pushing, shoving ... you know, got into a thing. Well, eventually the hearing officer, the judge, chastised the teachers for not doing what they should have been doing, and thanked us as parents for taking an interest. And that even annoyed me, because I thought, Why do you have a stereotype that parents wouldn't have an interest in their children? But there are so many ingrown concerns that people have about other people and how they act or don't act. And so we ended up closing the street, we ended up doing all kinds of things to have demonstrations, and finally they agreed to having somebody on patrol. Now, this isn't now, where you have guns being looked at or security things going on with the children. This was a little seven-year-old girl, and nobody protected her and nobody said, We're sorry. And she was whisked away, and she was sent to another school.\n",

      "STEINEM: That came about (laughs) in a typically atypical way, which was that the publisher who had published the first book, Outrageous Acts, had access to unpublished photographs of Marilyn Monroe, and asked me if I would write text to go with them. It happened that we also owed that publisher a lot of money, because we had used my book as a subscription premium and then not had the money to fully pay for those copies. So in order to pay the debt, and also because, like many women, I think, I had always had a kind of rescue fantasy about Marilyn Monroe, in the sense that, had there been a women's movement, would she still be alive? So many things about her were like exaggerated versions of many women's experiences: being sexually abused as a child; being abandoned by her mom ... a single mom; abandoned first by her father; and certainly being treated as an object more than a person in many ways, especially before she became famous, but even afterward. So if she had felt less alone in those experiences, would she have been able to survive? So I was also fascinated, but if it hadn't been for paying the debt and the photographs, I probably wouldn't have done it. I would have contented myself with a brief essay that I did for Ms. magazine about her\n",

      "TOURÃƒÂ‰: OK. As I recall, there was, in 1970 or '71, there was this big women's speak-out in New York, where all these women came and they talked about feminism and sexism and chauvinism and all of those kinds of things. And were kind of assessing, I guess, in a way, assessing the women's movement and identified violence against women as a really big issue, you know, not just ERA, for the equal pay thing, or the right to have an abortion, but violence against women, and out of that, the women who participated in that session, a couple of them came from D.C., and so they decided that they were going to start a rape hotline. ROSS: Do you remember their names? TOURÃƒÂ‰: They started the rape hotline in Jackie McMillen's apartment on 17th & Q Street Northwest, here in the District of Columbia, down in Dupont Circle, with this mustard-yellow answering machine. ROSS: Who was the other woman? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Took training. There was Lois Yankowski, Jackie McMillen, Deb Freedman. She came fairly early on, I believe. Val Jones, who worked with the Women's Legal Defense Fund, very instrumental in getting the first My Sister's Place started and all of that. It was a group of women like that, trained themselves to be able to work on a hotline and take the calls and they developed a very strong political analysis about rape and its relationship to power. All the things that everyone criticized women for having as part of an analysis of violence against women ... who now, the mainstream themselves, embrace a large part of that ideology or that perspective, that politic, or that analysis, however you want to say it, about that, that they didn't do before, Post Traumatic Stress [Disorder], you know, rape trauma syndrome, just any number of things that the women were saying in '72, '73, '74 went on for so long, that the more traditional society, law enforcement, medical, social, was rejecting all of that, have now had to come around and embrace it. And not just embrace it, but kind of like take it over and claim it, like this was their thinking, their theory, all along and all the time, which was just so outrageous, such revisionist history. In that house, in that apartment on Q Street, and it stayed there in Jackie's apartment for some time. And from Jackie's apartment, the first place it went was to that small, two-room across the street from Lincoln Junior High School on 16th and Irvin Street. ROSS: OK. There were some feminist magazines, and wasn't there a group called the D.C. Area Feminists Alliance? TOURÃƒÂ‰: FAAR. ROSS: Feminist [Alliance] Against Rape. Tell me about FAAR and ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, FAAR was ... some of the women in FAAR were from the Rape Crisis Center who had left the Rape Crisis Center, wanted to do something else or do some things differently, and so there were people who were interested in publishing, and they got interested because there was also a quarterly scholarly magazine called Quest. Quest preceded FAAR, you know, because it was more scholarly, a quarterly and all that. So you had women who worked on Quest who were interested in putting some focus around rape and so forth, and you had women who had been at the Rape Crisis Center who had an interest in putting out written materials and educating in that way, so they got FAAR magazine. The thing I'm trying to remember, because it had two incarnations, as FAAR and as Aegis magazine. And actually, what I think is that they became FAAR the collective. The magazine was Aegis magazine, and it carried articles and information on sexual assault and theory around sexual assault, you know, all kinds of tips, this, that, the other, different stuff, stories, articles that had to do with empowering women and all of that. Later, Aegis joined with ... oh, yes, and of course, dealing with pornography as well. Later, Aegis joined with domestic violence and half the magazine would deal with issues related to sexual assault, pornography, and the other half would deal with issues dealing with battering and domestic violence. ROSS: Did you get the sense that in the early years, the people at the Rape Crisis Center worked on other forms of violence that women experienced, or was it just gender-based violence? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It was gender-based violence. However, definitely gender based, although the Center did recognize that it was possible for a man to be raped, it was obviously not the primary focus, but there was certainly the acknowledgment that men could be sexually assaulted. You had individuals who worked at the enter who may have had involvement and ties into other movements around other issues, but the Crisis Center was strictly dealing with rape and had its hands full to deal with that, because in '72 and '75, I mean, the police, everybody, I mean, it was a battle. You know, if we ... it still continues to be a struggle, you know, but it was a battle. It was a war, you know, in terms of they didn't want you to have companions. I mean, all rape crisis centers, now you can have a companion with the woman at the hospital that's from the center. So, Oh, no, you couldn't do that. They didn't want you there because you impeded the investigation by being there. So then it was, like, the only way you could be there was if the woman requested that you be there. I mean, it was all these things, you know. Women asked for it. It was just horrendous. So they weren't just dealing ... they were not really making connections to anything else. They were dealing with the dynamics of gender, you know, and as time moves forward, began to ... around different issues, make connections, broaden out ... ROSS: OK. Now, you're saying that your working at the Rape Crisis Center affected your marriage. In what way did your consciousness that you developed at the Center cause you to re-look at your marriage? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It wasn't working at the Rape Crisis Center that caused me to ... I didn't need Rape Crisis Center. I mean, in all honesty, I didn't need the Rape Crisis Center to help me with that at all. When I was saying, working, I meant working in terms of the finances of it. You know, where if the man doesn't have a regular job or steady job and you do even just part-time, full-time, whatever it is, the dynamics that that creates. No, it wasn't a consciousness from the Rape Crisis Center. It was just the consciousness of, you got to go, because somebody's going to get hurt, OK. And so, I ain't fit for it to be me, so, and you're not leaving my child no place else, so you got to go\n",

      "I was not as active on the local level, but I joined NOW and all those good old great ones and became a real advocate for not just social workers, but women in those positions, women in the field. So that&#8217;s been my focus all these years. I&#8217;m a very verbal person, and so I made lots of speeches when I was with-the next program that I worked in in Child and Family was the Project Against Sexual Abuse of Appalachian Children. So that included, as I shared with you on the phone, I think, that agency had sort of a research project that started with setting up a helpline in 1979. The helpline was for women and children to call in and report just to the helpline or just to talk about their abuse, primarily sexual abuse was the target. And that meant any women that had been sexually abused as a child or were still or had been raped or a child that had been molested or somehow been offended sexually. So that sort of experiment or, in research terms, sort of out there to gather data, that following next year, the referrals to the Department of Human Services went up four hundred percent. So that data was used to support getting the funding for a regional research and service delivery system for abuse victims and so that&#8217;s where the Project Against Sexual Abuse of Appalachian Children. It&#8217;s an unwieldy name, but PASAAC, and I was clinical supervisor there for six years. So I did a lot of speaking at that time throughout the southeast. And what we did was try to get the various parts of the systems that deal with abuse to talk to each other. Police-if a rape was reported, how do they talk to the victim? What kind of services were available at the emergency center, the emergency rooms? Of course, the Department of Human Services that gave services to children, often they weren&#8217;t communicating with anybody. The sheriff&#8217;s department, the police, all of those people needed to coordinate services and learn how to not do further damage because the interrogation, particularly around rape, man, it was almost as bad as the rape sometimes for women. So we advocated strongly for that to change and for a more humane, more private inquiry, and did a lot of training throughout the southeast all the way from Texas to South Carolina, Florida. JW: Was there openness to that kind of change or what was that process like? RJ: What was that process? (laughs) Well, the big resistance, you can imagine, was from [males].We wanted to include doctors and many physicians would not, were the most resistant group. And I&#8217;m not sure why that was. I think a lot of that was because there weren&#8217;t very many women physicians at that point. And I think that, number one, a lot of men had not been trained to really see rape as [a crime]. They saw it as, well, did she have any injuries, was she pregnant, and that&#8217;s it, and not any of the psychological impact of being assaulted that way. JW: Were you trying to get them to report cases? RJ: Yes, definitely trying to get, well, trying to help them help the victim, to take charge, and to talk about it. A lot of women still won&#8217;t talk about being raped because back then, of course, there was very anti-female [attitude]. First of all, rape didn&#8217;t exist. Number two, if you were raped, you asked for it, you wanted it, because you wore that skirt too short or you were being seductive or you didn&#8217;t say \"no\" loud enough. Why did you finally give in? Nobody can [be raped]. It was a lot of old boy things: \"Well, nobody gets raped. If you don&#8217;t want to have sex then you just say no.\" But the fact that the man was two hundred and fifty pounds and the woman was a hundred had nothing to do with it. So there was a lot of denial of inequities, physical strength and intimidation, and then the women often felt so guilty and so dirty. All she wanted to do was forget it, and so there was not much follow-up for the mental health [treatment]. So as the next project that I worked on, as clinic supervisor at the Sexual Assault Center, which was an agency designed specifically to work with women and children. [The] women that had been sexually assaulted or had been sexually abused as children and were still dealing with the trauma. So I ran a group for nine years for women that had been sexually assaulted or had reoccurring memories. The whole memory thing got really to be an issue. And then, of course, I had staff that worked with children that had been abused, a lot of play therapy and those kinds of things. JW: And what year did you start that? RJ: Oh gosh. I left Child and Family in &#8217;86-no, I started in private practice in &#8217;86. I left Child and Family in &#8217;84. I went with Overlook Mental Health Center for a couple years and then I went in private practice. And when I went in private practice in &#8217;86, then that&#8217;s when I associated also with the Sexual Assault Center. There was three of us on staff, four on staff at the time and so I was the clinical supervisor and then we started adding staff. I was there for fifteen years on some level. JW: So how were you learning to counsel people through this when, like you said, rape didn&#8217;t exist? You were part of that movement to say, \"Wait a second. It does.\" RJ: It does exist and it has more than physical impact on the victim. Well, how were we learning that? Well, learning how to be a counselor, quote, therapist. Counseling usually is around solving problems, defining problems and solving problems in a real sort of one, two, three way. That&#8217;s my definition. Now therapy is a much longer and more in-depth look at how you reacted to the problem on an emotional level and what that did to your mental health. What has it done? Do you find yourself depressed, staying in bed all day long, or continuing to get into self-destructive, abusive relationships? That takes a long time to figure out how to break those patterns and we&#8217;re now learning a whole lot more about the brain. If I had time to go, I&#8217;d be a neurologist. I would study that and how to educate people to train their brain differently. We know that can happen now. We have the technology, and we have the expertise. But anyway, back to how do you learn how to deal with somebody about a behavior or an event that supposedly doesn&#8217;t happen. (laughs) Well, the first thing you do is say, \"It does happen.\" And again, since we&#8217;re products of our culture, you have to do a lot of work on yourself, or at least I did, in saying, \"Yeah, that happens and yes, it&#8217;s not good and yes, most of the victims are women, but also little boys get raped and vulnerable males also get raped.\" So you have to sort of retrain your own thinking about that and disconnect yourself from the common belief system. It has some service in the community to deny certain things and so you have to figure out, okay, if I rock the boat, what happens? What role do I play? It&#8217;s like the whole thing with women, the women&#8217;s movement. There was this thought that women, you can have it all. You can&#8217;t have it all. You have to make choices. You can&#8217;t be the CEO of a multimillion-dollar corporation and be there every time your kid has a fever. You can&#8217;t do it. So you make choices.\n",

      "There&#8217;s a controversial article out now in a leadership journal written by a former youth pastor who is serving in prison right now for statutory rape of one of his students, so it&#8217;s very controversial because the article is overly sympathetic to his perspective. A lot of people are upset about the article, so I&#8217;ve been tweeting about&#8211;. I mean it&#8217;s this problem that people don&#8217;t understand how pervasive this problem is. And when I was in that suburban high school, my junior year my health teacher tried to seduce me and, I mean, I wasn&#8217;t interested at all. But anyway, so I have this contrast of experiences.\n",
