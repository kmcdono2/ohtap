    "DESCRIPTION-------\n",
    "Example code for reading NVivo coded content from an NVivo extract into a pandas dataframe. \n",
    "Here we read in two files, one containing an extract of all NVivo coding except errors (everything_but_errors_12-22-20.xls), and \n",
    "another containing only the error coding (errors_12-22-20.xls). The code itself is trivial and the important points are contained in the NOTES.\n",
    "NOTES-------\n",
    "1) dependencies: the df.read_excel() in pandas uses the xlrd package internally, so you need to pip or conda install xlrd\n",
    "2) need to export the NVivo extract as an .xls file \n",
    "  - NOT .xlsx, because for some reason xlrd now only supports the older .xls file type\n",
    "  - NOT .csv because some cell values (description, coded text, maybe others) can contain commas and it is a hassle to work around this\n",
    "3) df.read_excel() cannot read the .xls file as directly exported from NVivo (NVivo's exported .xls file is malformed according to .read_excel()'s requirements)\n",
    "So as a workaround, you can \"repair\" NVivo's .xls file by doing the following (but the .xls files contained in ohtap/NVivo_output/data are already repaired, so \n",
    "no need to do this step unless you are working with .xls files you exported yourself from NVivo):\n",
    "   -open up the .xls file that was exported from NVivo in some spreadsheet software (I used mac's Numbers application, but Google Sheets or Excel would probably work too)\n",
    "   -re-export the opened file as another .xls file (which will now be well-formed for .read_excel()). In the Numbers application, what you do precisely is\n",
    "     + navigate to File -> Export To -> Excel...\n",
    "     + under \"Advanced Options\" change file type to .xls\n",
    "     + in the Excel Worksheets field, select \"One Per Table\" and nothing else (in particular, unselect \"Include a summary worksheet\" if that was selected by default\")\n",
    "     + click next and save the repaired file where you want\n",
