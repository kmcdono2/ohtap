      "[\"So I was the first volunteer secretary of the branch here. Well, we had some pretty strong cases, cases like the DiMarco-Bob White case. Most of the cases were rape cases where white people used to become dissatisfied and disgruntled about a thing. The best way they could do, some white woman would holler that she'd been raped by a Negro or ventured to rape, or something like that, and of course that meant a burned or lynched Negro. And so this happened down at Conroe. But we were able to get a lawyer - this was one of NAACP's first projects - and a lawyer that won that case in our favor. And the day of the trial when he was declared innocent and turned loose, they shot him right in the jail house, I mean right in the courthouse down in Conroe, that's in Montgomery County. Well, those things were so exciting to me, I did not know that people could be treated like people in Houston were being treated. Not only in cases like that, but in jail, prisoners generally, why, they would beat up people and anything they wanted to do and kill people. And NAACP then became the sole interest of mine.\", \"Knowing the role that you have played in many controversial issues and in many circumstances that were very tension-producing, I know you know a great deal about some of the things that have happened that are not very pleasant.

Did we really have police brutality and do you think it still exists, if it ever did? Oh yes, we've had some terrible incidents and some very brutal policemen. During the days I was with the NAACP, I almost could bet you money on that, if they arrested a Negro, they were going to take him out on the outskirts of town somewhere first and beat him up, and then bring him back and throw him in jail. And hardly anybody ever was put in jail that came out without being beaten.

And they always said theyÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â»Ã‚Â¿43 (cont) sometimes would have to tie their feet and hands and beat them down and all that to subdue them.

And I'm recalling that on past occasions I read a great deal about police brutality in Houston. Do you think the things that the news media have released at various times might have been valid? Did we really have police brutality and do you think it still exists, if it ever did?\n",
