Well, we had some pretty strong cases, cases like the DiMarco-Bob White case. Most of the cases were rape cases where white people used to become dissatisfied and disgruntled about a thing. The best way they could do, some white woman would holler that she'd been raped by a Negro or ventured to rape, or something like that, and of course that meant a burned or lynched Negro. And so this happened down at Conroe. But we were able to get a lawyer - this was one of NAACP's first projects - and a lawyer that won that case in our favor. And the day of the trial when he was declared innocent and turned loose, they shot him right in the jail house, I mean right in the courthouse down in Conroe, that's in Montgomery County. Well, those things were so exciting to me, I did not know that people could be treated like people in Houston were being treated. Not only in cases like that, but in jail, prisoners generally, why, they would beat up people and anything they wanted to do and kill people. And NAACP then became the sole interest of mine.References 3-4 - 0.77% CoverageKnowing the role that you have played in many controversial issues and in many circumstances that were very tension-producing, I know you know a great deal about some of the things that have happened that are not very pleasant.

Did we really have police brutality and do you think it still exists, if it ever did? Oh yes, we've had some terrible incidents and some very brutal policemen. During the days I was with the NAACP, I almost could bet you money on that, if they arrested a Negro, they were going to take him out on the outskirts of town somewhere first and beat him up, and then bring him back and throw him in jail. And hardly anybody ever was put in jail that came out without being beaten. And they always said theyÃ¯Â»Â¿43 (cont) sometimes would have to tie their feet and hands and beat them down and all that to subdue them.

We didn't rebel against this, that and the other, because we were not mistreated. We'd go into a store...

So they fitted our shoes, they fitted our hats, they fitted our dresses. And we had no reason to complain, except that we were not satisfied, naturally, but nobody did anything to us. We were not molested. I can't say now that things are better, because our people, as I see it, just weren't ready for desegregation.

So one day, Lionel called me and he said that there was a thing going on before the city council. They were working on a thing about the slave markets. These were places in the Bronx, in Brooklyn, in fact, in most of the boroughs, where large numbers of the black women would come and stand on a street corner. Then people would drive up in their cars, look them over, and select one they wanted to have work for the day. Then they took them to their homes and hadÃ¯Â»Â¿22 (cont.) them work. And all kinds of things were happening. I had worked with these girls. Lionel knew about this, because this was the kind of thing we talked about when we got together, "What's happening to our people? What should we be doing about it?" So it wasn't just that I was a staff person doing casework in the daytime, but then we would sit down and talk after work. I told him about a young womanÃ¢Â€Â”two of them in fact. One was a girl who had come up from the South, and someone had lured her to this place, because she was living in the YWCA. The job that she came to do only lasted a short while. Some told her to go up to this slave market. She went up to the slave market, and a woman came and got her, and she worked in this woman's house. And then somehow or other, when the woman left the house, the man of the house simply took advantage of her, and the girl was so young, she didn't know what to do. So she came in to talk to me about it, to see what could be done. The man threatened to have her arrested if she told anything about what had happened. Well, I searched and searched and couldn't find anything at all that we could do. The girl almost went into shock. She must have been about seventeen or eighteen, seventeen,I think. After a very short period of time, this girl was pregnant and I had to see her all the way through that pregnancy. I got her into the Club Caroline, and she had come from a very, very poor Southern family, and the thing that worried her the -most was, What would her mother ever say? So we had to have all kinds of special care for her. Was she singular or were there many like that? There were many who had problems. I suppose many of them would have worked them out different ways. Some of the young people took up money to help her. I helped her to get some work around the Y, got her a little job on the elevator. But as time went on, she became so depressed that she was a liability on the elevator. We really had to see her all the way through it. It was a terrific thing.

There were a lot of them, she had a lot of brothers and sisters. And so, one day, I asked Grandmother why Mama didn't favor Grandpa Patrick Covington and why she didn't favor her other brothers and sisters. I remember, Mama told us,"Hush, don't ask such questions." Grandmother said, "Yes, they do." Grandmother said, "Your mother's father is a white man. He was the son of my overseer in the family to whom I belonged." And she said that on the eve of or after the Emancipation, "Your mother was born in 1865." Grandmother said, "I was a house servant. I was never mistreated by the family. I was like a member of the family, but this young boy," she said, "he didn't rape me, but he took advantage of me and your mother was born to the slave master's son." And she said, "Later or., I married Patrick Covington and to Patrick Covington, all of these children were born." Then we always understood why Mother did not favor her brothers and sisters.

Now that was within the race. And it was true of grown people. But I hasten to say what I found out. When I found it out, I don't know. As we were removed from slavery, you don't find as many bright colored people as you saw 70, 80 years ago. All mothers during slavery who had bright children were not raped. They knew that if their children had a white father and if those children were light, they would have better advantages in the world. Many of the white men during slavery educated their children. Many of the women who had children by those white men were house servants. They had charge of that man's house, all the cooking, all the cleaning. They even nursed the white woman's babies. The white women were ladies. They did nothing but sit in the front room and dress and sleep. It was not until white women rose up against that, and told their men they would not allow them to accept these black women any more, that that was stopped. Now those of us who remember that are not as mad as perhaps those who think that all black women were raped. They were not. There are many bright colored people who were as close to their white parents as we are to our black ones.<Files\\BWOH\\BWOH_Kittrell_Flemmie> - § 1 reference coded  [1.85% Coverage]Reference 1 - 1.85% CoverageComing on further, I stopped over in Japan, that was the time it was occupied by the United States Army, and of course I didn't like the looks of it and was so pleased when that occupation ended.

They had already had some programs along this line, in kind of a neighborhood way, but they had it much more organized, the government was in back of it. And the thing that impressed me the most was that I lived in the homes of the Japanese people and that's when you really learn a great deal. Having tea, seeing how well they took care of their children again, and I saw absolutely no child abuse, just none, no child abuse whatsoever. The children were loved and cared for, and they were helped to do things that they wanted to do. I saw no one scolding any children. I made a real point of that. Had you noticed that among the Japanese people? MT: Well, I wasn't there probably under the same arrangements as you had, but even though Japan had been through a war, the children weren't like children in India. FPK: No, they were not. They were very different. But you know, on the other hand, I think the war had been over about two years when we were there, and by that time, the Japanese people had been able to do a great many things to bring them back to their normality. I found there was no food shortage, the children were well fed, but more than that, they were well treated as humans, with thinking powers of their own, and their parents and the other adults appreciated it and also encouraged it. I felt very good about that, and believed that we could learn a great deal from the Japanese people on child rearing. MT: No doubt... FPK: There was no child abuse at all!

AM: My father was St. Cyr Moore. Father was a very handsome man, about six feet tall, and broad shouldered, very powerful man, powerfully built, very good looking, extremely good looking. And I understood that he married my mother more out of spite than anything else. His second wife was one of those...they call them octoroons in New Orleans. That is, you couldn't tell her from white. Obviously the daughter of a lot of raping in that family. And my mother was your complexion, and this was supposed to have been a cardinal sin, for a man of his complexion to marry a brown woman. And so the prejudice was very high against color in the South. The light-skinned people felt that they were superior to the black-skinned people, and this was taught to us, it was taught. Everything that happened in your life was to demean the original people, the African complexion. And the ones who was mixed with the white blood was better. It's a terrible scourge; that was, again, an injury against us. They added insult to the injury; after raping us, then teaching us that we were better than the black ones that had escaped the rape, you see? So this always had somewhat an effect on me. When Marcus Garvey came on the scene, then of course a deep consciousness was awakened in me. And I recall the lynching; my grandfather was lynched. CG: Ah. Your father's father or your mother's father? AM: My mother's father was lynched. My grandmother's husband was lynched and... CG: Now was this the grandmother that you went to stay with?Ã¯Â»Â¿5 AM: Yes, that was Grandma, and you couldn't tell her from a white woman to save your life, which shows all the rape that went on in our family. You know, I mean with our people. CG: And he was lynched? AM: Yes. He was a black man, he was very black, and he was lynched for standing up to some white people who wanted his land. This was all it amounted to, because after he was lynched they ran my grandmother off the land, and she had to take her five little children and flee for her life with the things they had on their back, nothing else, leave everything, their cattle, they had cattle and everything on her farm. So all of her children, Grandma had to place them with white people. Now white people in those days, the French whites, they had a custom of having a little black child in the home to play with their little children. I mean people who don't see the prejudice against black people today can't understand this, that they would rather have a black child play with their children than for their children to socialize with the little white child who was lower in rank than them, you see?Reference 4 - 0.95% Coverage I found our little girls in the crazy house, or the insane or whatever you want to call it, mental institutions, little twelve-year-old girls, ten and twelve years old, having babies for white attendants in the insane asylum and nobody paid that any attention.

And so, Caucasians would not always know people who were black. She could go out as she could find out many things. She found out from the neighbors what type of people these parents of the girl were. She defended this young man and other young people as well to keep them out of prisons, because we didn't have any juvenile homes in those days. And because of her they went to reformatories instead.

In terms of these new feminist consciousness raising groups? Lamphere: Well, I worked on a number of different things. You know, first we did sort of consciousness raising. And then we decided well, we should do something at Brown, right? And, Bev Daniels and Karen Romer didn't come until ˜72. But somewhere in there we were trying to figure out how to get to the community. And it turned out when we started doing that, the people who were most interested in having some connection with Brown were like faculty wives and other people who lived on the East Side. So out of that, I think, some of the administrators like Karen sort of worked on having, you know. a program for older women to return to Brown. And some of that involved, beginning to sort of do women's studies courses. But we did things like, I mean some people were involved in establishing a rape crisis center. But we als--I remember there was a big hearing at the, the statehouse, over abortion rights. And, you know, we never figured we would get very far with it because Rhode Island was such a Catholic state. But there was a committee that was hearing, you know, an abortion rights bill and a bunch of us went down and did testimony for it. And the room was completely crowded. And the issue was, was it going to get out of committee into the legislature, and I don't think it even did that. But there was beginning to be this ferment about, around these women's issues like rape crisis and abortion and, you know, women's rights in general. References 3-4 - 1.24% CoverageBut that you personally can make a change in things if you work with organizations that are trying to make change, become part of social movements that are trying to make change. And one of the things I'm trying to do in an article I'm going to write for feminist--sort of new feminist stuff going on in anthropology is about the relationship between women and social movements, because we came out of a social movement in the ˜70s. And the African-American women and the Latina women in anthropology that became feminist anthropology came out of social movements, out of the civil 48 rights movement, and out of the La Raza movement. And they all contributed to the diversification of feminist anthropology. But now you get--we get women who are studying other social movements. Some of which they're part of, like women are interested in migration and immigrant rights, doing feminist work on immigrant rights. Other women are working on food sustainability, issues about, you know, things that have come back up like rape, abuse against women, abortion rights still there. You know, that kind of stuff. And then a lot of women are in the LGBT movement, and working for marriage equality and so forth. So I've got students that have been working on those issues, people that are putting out some collections right now. So there's a whole stream of feminist anthropology where we've taken this idea that the personal is political, and [2:45:00] carried it into our research as being more, sort of, public anthropologists. Anthropologists who are working on critical social issues today, that are being pushed forward by new social movements. And understanding the relationship between these social movements and social change, and how you actually effect change, what mistakes social movements make, how they get anything done, where they get defeated, how they do confront people who have the opposite point of view, et cetera. So I think there's a way in which social movements have been very important to feminist anthropology, and continue to be in this kind of new way. References 5-6 - 0.30% Coverage Lamphere: Well the part that was there already was my participation in the feminist movement since 1970, okay?

That he shouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be threatened and intimidated into this testimony. So we got a hold of that. And -- because Larry gave it to me.

She took me in the kitchen. She got me a glass of water, and she said, "Julie is not coming back." And I said, "Did they move?" You know, 'cause I'm thinking, you know, trying to think. She said, "No, she's not coming back." She said, "Julie has gone on to heaven." And I said, "Why would she do something like that?" I mean it's just not making sense to me as a, as a, as, as someone that age. And when it finally soaked in, that she was telling me that Julie had died, she said you know--I had a hard time with it. I went to bed, and I mean my mother had to almost kill me to get me to get up out of that bed and go to school the next day. But it just, I, I just couldn't, I could not function. I shut down.

She didn't look like, you know, it was Julie, but it wasn't Julie, that kind, that kind of thing.

The body of a child gives because the penetrator cannot. He can't stop. And so, so he told me the rapist told me that he would kill my brother if I told anyone. And I was sick. I really became sick and my underclothes which I had hidden under the mattress. My mother said the mattress must be changed, everything must be changed and of course these panties fell out, and there was all the story. And so, they asked me who and I wouldn't tell. Bailey came to me. He said Maya you have to tell it. You have to say who told you--who did this to you or he will do it to another little girl. And I told him that the man said if I told the man would kill Bailey. Bailey was nine years old. He said I won't let him. So I believed him. Of course he's Bailey. So I told him. The man was put in jail for one day and released and three days later, police came into my mother's mother's house in St. Louis where we were visiting and told her that the man was found dead and it seems he was kicked to death. I thought that my voice had killed him and that my voice could just kill anybody. It could go out of the keyhole and kill people I don't--didn't even know, black people and white people, all kinds of people, children. So I stopped speaking. My mother's family and she did their best to woo me away from my mutism but they didn't know what I knew. So I just stopped.

He says, "Well, you're not gonna boss me." I say, "Oh, okay." It's cool you know. So, but I, I come in--to terms with my life in terms of how the abuse happened and, you know, my mom [Dorothy Amos Brock], she didn't know any better. She didn't, she didn't know how to get counseling for us, she, she did the best she knew how. And, I eventually shared that with her in a repeat back to Oprah's show ['The Oprah Winfrey Show'], it's, you know, it's hard but that was my life, along with some of my sisters. My sisters were able to come through the abuse really well, but I--it took me a while and even now in relationships, you know, I'm a lot more cautious you know, with the kind of men that come into my life and things like that. I still have a good relationship with, with the people who abused me. I don't think of them any longer as monsters because, you know, they were going through transitions as well and it's just one of those things that happens in life that you just have to kind of like watch all of your children. You just have to watch your cousins, you know, and my, my parents they just had too many of us to watch all of us, you know, they just--couldn't do it, they just couldn't do it. References 2-3 - 1.90% Coverage Speaker 1: I remember one time, I was at the university [Mississippi Valley State University, Itta Bena, Mississippi], I got raped, you know, at the university, you know, it's, you know. I remember I could go on and on with all these different things and--. I remember the parents of the kid who raped me, they pleaded to me, they said, "Please, please don't have him sent up on charges because it'll ruin his life." And I convinced myself, without my parents' [Dorothy Amos Brock and Herman Brock, Sr.] help to drop the charges, you know. But, you, you get to a place that you think to yourself some of the things that happen in life they happen as a result of choices that you make and I know the choice that I made that day. I went into the male's dorm, which I should not have done, and I don't know what I could have expected, you know, as I look at it today. But that still did not give him a right to rape me, but-- Speaker 2: Right. Speaker 1: --but it is what it is, you know. Speaker 2: Do you regret not pressing charges now or-- Speaker 1: No, I don't regret it. I'll tell you why I don't regret it because I think that I had to take a responsibility for what action happened that day as well as that gentleman. We were very young and it could have been consensual, but I did remember saying, "No." But, I don't think my life right now, I would be where I am now if I had gone through with that because you can really hurt other people and I, when I talked to his parents, his parents was, you know, it, it could have gone any, any way. It could, it could have been that I could've agreed just by going into the room. It's just so many ways that you can look at it you know. And I know back in that day, you know, rape, rape is rape no matter what. But I do not remember saying to him, "Let's go to the next step." But I did go into his dorm, so a lot of that weighted on that, you know, in my decision. And when I dropped those chor-, charges, those charges being dropped was weighted on the fact that I could mess up his life and maybe mess up my life as well. So I weighed it on that and we both live good lives now, you know. I, I, went on to graduate from college, he graduated from college, he lives a prosperous life. But you know those things would not be there for him. I remember going to the c-, the jail in Greenwood [Mississippi] and seeing him behind bars, you know, that, that left a mark on me because I, I look at it now and look at how the systems are set up, you know, it, it's gotta always be a place where we can come and meet and say, you know what, I made a mistake, you made a mistake. And I think at that time I wasn't smart enough, but something inside of me was smart enough for me to recognize that I did not wanna mess up his life because a mis-, a mistake that the two of us had made. So when I moved from that point to there--and I later on went on to, to date a professor (laughter) at the university so, it's, you know, I, I had a really good life as, you know, as a, as a, as a student at the university.<Files\\HM\\HM_Brooks_Queen> - § 4 references coded  [3.52% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.07% CoverageI had a bad experience there that maybe you might wanna know later, but as a child, I did have a very bad experience.

But I had gone and he had, you know, come and sat down beside me, then he, you know, start touching me and then he asked me to sit on his lap so I got up and I left and I told my mother and consequently he was put in jail.

Speaker 2: Okay, how do I say this? My son's birth was the results of child molestation. And his father is dead, and I guess the only reason I can say that is that my son [Leslie Brooks] is also dead. But it, it was, you know, it was, it was, it was really something that I found, and find still difficult to talk about, because it, it was carried on all the time that I was a child, and as--and then I grew up under that, and after that maybe last time I became pregnant, and I told my mother [Hattie Steele Owens] who the father was, but I never told her that he had molested me since I was probably five and--because she would've killed him. Story_ID: 635377 Speaker 1: At that time then did--what did you tell your mother [Hattie Steele Owens]? Did you-- Speaker 2: I, I told my mother--well actually I did not tell my mother, my mother sort of told me. I told my mother I was pregnant and I did not--I knew nothing about being a woman, a being a--pregnancy, sex, nothing because my parents didn't talk to me. We did not have sex education in school when I was growing up and when I was going to school. I knew nothing about it. I thought I was just eating way too much and I was getting bigger and then someone suggested that you know, I may be pregnant and I was like, how? You know, I just couldn't believe I was pregnant. And then I found out I was and I, and I wrote a long letter and told my mother that I was pregnant and that I was sorry, you know, and she came to the school [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], I was in bed and she woke me up and, you know, I was scared like you would not believe. She scared the daylights out of (laughter) me. And so, she told me it could be one or two people. She said, "You only been around two people, two males and so--," you know, I told her who it was, and then I just--that's all I said, you know, I never told her anything about being molested since I was so little, you know, because I really feared for his life--I mean I thought he was gonna be in trouble anyway. But had I told her all this, all this time that that's wha- that you know, he had been sexually, you know, molesting me. I'm, I'm sure my father [Pomp Brooks] would have gone back to jail for something like that. Speaker 1: So what did happen to him? Speaker 2: Nothing. He came over, he agreed to take, you know, responsibility and support the, the child, you know, he was very calm and cool about it. I guess he knew I hadn't told the whole thing, you know, and so, he did for a while and--but I--you know I wouldn't see him. But I, you know, I didn't find out until years, years later that that's what had been happening to me, you know, and I found that out and listening to Oprah Winfrey and finding out that it wasn't my fault, you know, so I just didn't like him anymore at all. And his family was well thought of and well liked by my family so I never told them either. In fact, I never even told them that he was the father, and he didn't tell them either.

Speaker 2: Um-hm. Speaker 1: Now, what were some of the cases that came before you that you can talk about? Can you talk about some of them? Speaker 2: Oh, sure. I mean, I, I dealt with any number of cases. We dealt with, not only divorces and dissolutions because we were a combined family court, but my toughest cases were dealing with bind over cases, you know, decisions where you had to, you had to make a decision about whether you help a juvenile in juvenile court or transfer them to adult court. Dealing with children who were raped by their parent's boyfriends or live-ins, some of the horrific abuse that I saw happened to kids. It, it was, it was a challenging court to be on. You can't even begin to imagine what people do, or will allow to be done to their children. It, it was shocking for me. And so, one of the things that I did, as I said to my staff, I said, "You know, look, we know we have six years. I don't know if they're going to give me more than that, but we know we have six." And the one thing I know about black robes is when you put them on, suddenly, the media cares what you have to say. And so, I made it very intentional to talk about abused children and how the system was treating them and pushing for improvement in how we dealt with these cases. Speaker 1: Okay. Now, we live in a time of increasing public scrutiny of certain kinds of crimes of that nature. Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: People abused, 'Oprah Winfrey Show' ['The Oprah Winfrey Show'], or these talk shows-- Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: --talk about these, but you're seeing things at another level. Speaker 2: Oh-- Speaker 1: You're seeing people actually walk in-- Speaker 2: Absolutely. Speaker 1: --on a level of intensity and we, we can't imagine. Speaker 2: I had, I will never forget this. I had a twelve year old who was pregnant by her mother's boyfriend. And the mother kept trying to convince me that he didn't do it. And I said, I finally looked at her, and I said, "Ma'am, we have the DNA. You can try to get your daughter to recant all you want to. That is his baby." And she looked at me, and she said, "Why do you keep babying her about this? She can get over it. I got over it, she can get over it." This is this child's mother, and she forced this twelve year old--and I'm not saying it was the wrong decision, but she did it out of her ownmotives. She never asked the child if she wanted to keep her baby. She told her she was giving it up for adoption. She said, "Because I have a baby by this guy, and it's going to be too weird. What, I'm raising my grandbaby who's a sibling to my son? That's not going to happen." So, this twelve year old, tears streaming down her face, not even understanding what's happening to her. She had depression, she was raped by her mother's boyfriend. And her mother, instead of trying to help her own daughter get through it, was there trying to get her daughter to say something that would allow the boyfriend not to go to prison. It, it and then, there were so many examples of that. I can't even begin to tell you. Speaker 1: Yeah, that's unfathomable, you know. You'd think she--what would he have to do for her if they want to get rid of him? I mean, I don't know, I think, you would think that'd be enough, right? Speaker 2: What, for the girl--oh, yeah, for the boyfriend (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) yeah (unclear). Speaker 2: Yeah. I think, you know-- Speaker 1: What could he do? Speaker 2: There are so many women who are so insecure that they would have rather settled for any piece of man than to be by themselves. You know, the one thing I learned growing up with my mother [Sylvia Banks Kendrick] is she said, "There's a difference between being alone and being lonely." She said, "Now, if I'm going to struggle, I'd rather struggle by myself," you know. And so many women would just rather say they have a man, even if it's somebody that abuses their kids or mistreats them. It's a phenomenon I still can't ever get used to. Story_ID: 638614 Speaker 1: Does the court hear--I mean, did the Franklin County court [Franklin County Court of Commons Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations and Juvenile Branch] when you were on the bench work with domestic violence programs and that sort of thing for (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We did, we did. But the court, the court can refer women to programs, but unless the woman really sees it as something she needs to go through, it just doesn't sustain. And that was part of our frustration is really--sometimes we'd have court orders over them, like if we had their children in custody, we could order mom into counseling, or into domestic violence treatment. And then, as a consequence of her not going, we could refuse to give her children back. But I had so many moms who didn't want their kids back. If they had to choose, they would choose the guy. Speaker 1: Okay. Were there--I know in Illinois, when I was in Chicago [Illinois] during those days, there was increased pressure put on the deadbeat fathers-- Speaker 2: Um-hm. Speaker 1: --to--did that happen here in Ohio? Speaker 2: Yes. I, I was one, you know, because of my life experience, I was one that was pretty stringent on people paying child support. You know, if you had a child, I expected you to take care of them. There's two people that made a baby, two people need to take care of a baby. So, but some of the cases--I mean, part of our challenge with some, some of the moms, we didn't know who the dad was. I literally had a case, I will kid you not, where I had six children--no, wait a minute--nine children, six fathers. You should have seen, we had to bring in extra tables for the hearing. The mom and dad were married so, and I actually had to graph it out because I couldn't understand it. So, the mom and dad were married, but mom's oldest child was not the husband's, even though the child was named after the husband. And during the course of the proceedings, the custody proceedings, the husband got mom's sister pregnant (laughter). It was--those were the things I dealt with every single day (laughter).Reference 4 - 3.24% Coverage Nationwide Children's, one of my friends was on the board and Nationwide Children's asked me to come and talk to them. And they wanted to create a one stop child abuse center because they had children who were sexually abused, spending hours in the emergency room, sometimes eight, ten, twelve hours waiting on detectives to get there, waiting on children's services to get there. So, they basically said, "This is kind of what we're thinking, but we'd like you with your experience to come in and design it." And so, I literally got the opportunity to plan, program, and build a center from the ground up. They had originally told me I had $3 million. I, I ultimately got $10 million, and we built a forty-two housand square foot facility that, now in Franklin County [Ohio], we've been open now for, since 2005 for seven years. So, we have literally changed the paradigm on how you treat abused children. What we did is we moved all of the systems that deal with seriously abused children into one location. This beautiful building looks like you're walking into somebody's living room. It doesn't look like a hospital. It doesn't look institutional. We moved our five child abuse physicians, nurse practitioners, eight trauma treatment therapists, seventeen detectives from our special victims bureau at the Columbus police department [Columbus Division of Police], ten children services investigators, two Franklin County prosecutors, a domestic violence therapist, a child psychiatrist, and the Columbus Coalition Against Family Violence [The Center for Family Safety and Healing, Columbus, Ohio] all in one location, all working together. It took us two years just to get the memorandums of understanding completed. But what--it's amazing what happens when you take six organizations that are used to pointing the finger at each other, which is what they used to do when I was on the bench; the police would blame children's services. Children's services would blame the prosecutor as to why nothing happened. But now, instead of being this anonymous name on a phone message, it's the person you see in the parking lot. It's the person you get coffee with in the morning. So, the beauty of this is that when a child is raped, they come to the center, and everybody they need to see is at the center: the detective's there, the children's services worker is here, the physician is there. We immediately get them into trauma treatment with a therapist. And so, oftentimes, the police detective is able to go and interview the alleged perpetrator before the mom can get home and say, oh, my god, this is what they found. So, it's a wonderful system. It was the work of my life. It's what I thought I was going to end my career doing. And then, Governor Strickland [Ted Strickland] called in 2010 (laughter). Speaker 1: Yeah. For the record, the name of the place is the Center for Child and Family Advocacy [The Center for Family Safety and Healing, Columbus, Ohio]-- Speaker 2: At Nationwide Children's-- Speaker 1: --at Nationwide Children's Hospital. Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: And this makes so much sense. Is this still going on? Speaker 2: It is. Speaker 1: And has it been replicated in others? Speaker 2: Yeah, we, and we actually weren't the first people to come up with this concept. I mean, there are centers like this that exist. Chicago [Illinois] has one. I went to visit the Chicago one. It's twenty-seven thousand square feet. That's when I knew I had to make it bigger. And Chicago's is a house, it's really kind of whimsical. They have windows that are on the floor, and they have windows that go up outside down, so it's really entertaining for a child to look at. But one of the things I--when I met with the director there, and I asked her, I said, "What would you do if you were doing different--doing it today differently?" She said, "I'd build it bigger." Because what we, what we everybody underestimated, which we got the benefit of their experience, is that when you create a safe place for people to come, where they don't have to go down to the police station, where they don't have to into a hospital emergency room, it makes it easier for people to come forward. So, I went to San Diego [California], I went to Chicago, I sent a consultant to Denver [Colorado], I went to Cincinnati [Ohio]. I went to Houston [Texas]. Houston has a fifty-six thousand square foot facility, and they were adding on to it at the time I visited them in 2002. So, we didn't create the model. I'd like to say that ours is the most comprehensive model because we included domestic violence because what we found in interviewing our families is that 60 percent of our parents gave a current or prior history of domestic violence, so we believed in terms of healing the child, we had to heal the family.

But things were getting very tough interracially so they went to Mississippi. I used to always wonder why didn't they go north. But they went to Mississippi where things were a little bit better, for a short time, then they got worse than Georgia. Mississippi passed a lot of rules that they called the blue codes and they were against interracial marriage and so forth. They, they took away the power of Reconstruction they nullified it and so all of the accomplishments that had been given to blacks or freedoms or rights that came with emancipation got vitiated you know. These two went to Mississippi and had four children. And as I understand Kelly was the only one who remained a Negro. The other three passed, and that's my understanding. And so my mother came--Kelly was her father--and I don't know beyond that.

But there was one year that there had been a rape that was very highly publicized and, and Ersa not only knew the young woman who had been raped but had taken her under her wing. And so this young woman was around during the time that I was around. And I didn't have any appreciation for what that was about, you know, I, again, I was probably about eleven or twelve.

A young child barely--a young female child, barely a teenager, maybe ten, maybe nine [years old], is married off and expected to give birth at that tender age once she's able to give birth; and of course that leads to all sorts of health problems. So, those are things that have to be addressed--childhood marriages that don't allow the young girl to live her life as a child. And usually, when she gets married and she gets pregnant, and during labor develops complications and develops what we call vesicovaginal fistula, she is now abandoned by the man who now takes another young girl, so their lives are just totally ruined. So, I do not see how religion can be supportive of destroying people's lives like that; so those are things that need to be addressed. <Files\\HM\\HM_Carwell_Hattie> - § 2 references coded  [0.29% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.29% CoverageSpeaker 1: Okay.

I had been working part time in a hospital, and a mother and child came in, and there was all this whispering and moving back and forth of doctors and nurses, and I learned that the child had been sexually assaulted. The mother was in denial about it, and there was all this discussion about how they were going to treat the child, and family services was going to have to be involved. And I didn't know anything, didn't know diddly-squat.

And they just wouldn't stop. They just wouldn't stop. They just wouldn't stop. And I went through a very very painful period in my life, months, of just, and everyone was dead. I had nobody to blame.

So, I had found out from my parents in that moment about ten years before I even met Cookie [Clarke's biological mother, Carole Cole] that I was biologically biracial and I told no one. I was not happy. I wanted to be what I had always thought I was for starters. And I had been raised with all this black pride, you know just steeped in black history and black culture and, and my West Indian heritage and all these things that you know okay biologically maybe I knew I wasn't West Indian but I loved my family and I loved everything I had been taught and I was so truly proud of our history as black people, African American, West Indian American, all of it. I did not want to be half white, I really did not. Story_ID: 660026 Speaker 1: And it changed also in my mind whatever fantasies I'd had about what the story might have been between my birth parents, which I think best case scenario, you know I envisioned this wonderful love story, these college students who were just you know so in love it was some kind of, you know black Romeo and Juliet thing. They just couldn't be together. That twisted into something else when I found out that my birth father was white and a whole realm of possibilities that I hadn't considered came into view for me. And, and you know I, I know that speaks to my own stuff you know. I, I had never thought my birth mother could possibly have been raped or taken advantage of even when I thought my father was black. When I found out he was white I thought about those things. What I didn't think was that they could have just been in love so that speaks to my own upbringing I guess. But as it turns out you know when I met Cookie [Clarke's biological mother, Carole Cole], I think she, she, she was in love. She had a huge crush on Stanley Goldberg. The feelings obviously were not balanced in return and for whatever reason she didn't feel ever at liberty to tell him that I even existed as a possibility. So, I've never gone looking for him for that reason. You know it's one thing to call your birth mother. She knows she gave birth to you but to call some poor guy who never knew you existed, who's gone on and had a whole life you know that's a, a very different thing and I just haven't wanted to do it. <Files\\HM\\HM_Cole_Brenda> - § 2 references coded  [0.51% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.51% CoverageSpeaker 2: And now meantime we hear of--of--for example, I remember whispers going on and you know.

And the father took the babysitter home and raped her and killed her. And I, I remember hearing about that, I know that growing up, my daddy [Garfield Hill] would never let us work for white people.

Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Speaker 2: My father--so he would say her hair was long enough for her to sit on and it was not a curl in her hair. And so again he would say she was whiter than any white woman that you ever meet. Her husband, my grandfather William Henry James [William James], was very dark complected which obviously gave birth to my uncles. My father was the second of four boys in the family. But back to my grandmother, it really wasn't until years later--I was a college student at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] when my father's younger brother Uncle Hilton, Hilton James--he was pastor of Berean Baptist Church in Brooklyn, New York. They're a prominent congregation in New York [New York]. Anyway, Uncle Hilton was at Hampton--Uncle Hilton attended Hampton and was very proud of the fact that I was matriculatin at Hampton at that time. And he was visiting and we were--he was telling me about his mother--and because I said daddy said that--that--gave--talked about her attributes being so fair skinned and he said, "Our mother wasn't fair skinned. Our mother was white." And I said well what's going on with that. He said that back in--I would assume Fluvanna County, because that's where she was born, my grandmother. They were three little white girls and they were raised by a woman that was very, very dark complected, Grandma Johnson [ph.] was their mother. But there was really no way that--and I'm using Uncle Hilton's words now that she--Grandma Johnson could've given birth to those three little white looking girls. So--but Grandma Johnson worked for a family in Virginia and she lived out in the back, and apparently this--someone in the family--a woman in the family or it could've been a couple of them had babies out of wedlock, had white babies--this is not miscegenation, this is not, you know, rape or incest, this is just someone who had babies out of--white babies out of wedlock. And in those days you lived up to the country like they lived. Every time this woman had a baby or one of these--it could've been sisters, it could've been just one whatever it wasn't clear. But every time there was--yeah at that time say illegitimate baby born, they would really in what essence toss the baby to the back yard to Grandma Johnson to raise. So, in essence, my grand- great-grandmother was raising these three little white girls for this family until circumstances occurred and Grandma Johnson relocated to Richmond with these three little girls. And one of those girls was my grandmother, Annie Carlisle [ph.] her--it was pronounced (pronunciation) Carlisle but it was Carlisle, is how you would spell it, Johnson James [Annie James] and Aunt Edna [ph.], who I did meet. I never met my grandmother but I did meet Aunt Edna. So I--if those kinds of stories are painful especially for people at that time--my father was very upset that my uncle shared that with me because I think he was more upset because of the fact that she'd be viewed as an illegitimate. I mean those days oh my god it was like--it was just such an insult. And he preferred to really think about my mother [sic.]--my father did, just during the time that she was, you know, married to his father and then raising them. Speaker 1: That's interesting. Yeah.

And you don't see kids playing kickball anymore. At least I don't see them, but that was some of my fondest memories are playing in the summers that I spent as a kid just canvassing that Glenville neighborhood there because see we had freedom as kids that kids don't seem to have today to be up all hours of the night, you now, not having to worry. I can remember, I lived on an alley as a kid and I'd go down the street to eat popcorn and watched the scary movies with Ghoulardi [stage persona of DJ Ernie Anderson] and stuff on Friday night. And then we would watch each other, a couple of us walking home down the alley. And we'd be spooked to death, but we really, really had to worry about somebody raping us or jumping us, you know, or assaulting us, whereas, that just seems to be so much present today for kids.

Because I can still visualize it. And that was being molested in the housing project at a very young age. And that part of the book was very hard, because my sister asked me not to write it. And it was, you know, difficult in terms of having a stranger enter our house, you know, late at night. Because my mother worked at night. And, you know, we answered the doorbell because he said he was a friend of my mother's. And to be violated as a young child--I think I was either four or five and my sister was six. And it was very hard. Because even today as I talk about it, I can see myself, you know, in the situation. And then our fear in terms of telling our mother. Because we were scared to tell her we had let someone in the house. And we were just frightened because we knew of a young girl who was close to us in age who had been found murdered in the apartment and her body incinerated. So we were just really very, very frightened. And then my mother went into denial about it happening. Which was--and even as we got older when we talked, you know, she just did not--she did not want us to talk about it. Because it meant that something that she had done wrong.

In addition to everything else I was raped in, while I was at Harvard, twice (laughter). I'd been so sheltered and so naive, so sheltered and so naive when I was Atlantic City [New Jersey]. Aunt Peggy [Bush] just, like the word "sex" was not uttered. I had no idea how to deal with or even recognize signals from men and therefore, could not, also not recognize when I need to get the hell out of there.

I just have some innate--my mother [Norma Greve Storch] always liked to say that she had that sort of hearty pioneer stock, you know, that Mormon (laughter), those Mormon pioneers that went West (laughter), you know.

They, of course, the leaders all anticipated this. This was all done on purpose. They wanted to be arrested. They indicated a little surprise at me being there.

Except when they came to arrest everybody, one of the policeman reminded another policeman that the law, I believe, he said says that when a woman is arrested she must be arrested by a woman cop, which may or may not be true. I'm inclined to believe it is, it was true because what advantage would it be for leaving me there. But, they arrested the men and I was left there with these terrible men behind the counter. I think there were five of them shouting insults to me that I cannot even repeat. I, I've never been that frightened in my life. I, I was, and, and I'm wondering if they're gonna rape me, 'cause that was suggested as part of the insults they were throwing at me. I said are these four men gonna rape me? Are they gonna kill me, or is, is this woman police person whose gonna arrest me is she really gonna come? And I prayed quietly. I didn't, I, I just prayed quietly, and, and was so frightened wondering could I withstand what I thought was gonna happen to me, could I try to kill myself.

I guess the biggest challenge was probably changing the image in that people thought basically as a black school and not necessarily as a very good educational institution. So, you know, there always would be little snippets in the papers. Little negatives about, you know, that would it occur at [College of] William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia] that would never even hit the papers. But always if it was something related to Hampton, the negatives got in, and very few of the positives. You know if say somebody raped someone. Well even though the student might not have--or the person may not have ever graduated from Hampton, if they ever went there, in their lifetime, then, you know, it was mentioned as, "Hampton somebody some--," you know. And so getting rid of the negatives related to the fact that this is a black institution and it's mediocre. To the fact that it's a great college education. It's a great university education. Changing really the image. The papers now give the positive things that are happening. The entire perception of Hampton over the last twenty years has changed significantly. And I would say if you're looking at HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] among the ones that have great reputations would be Hampton or Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] or Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].

My mother went out there, stood in front of him and started screaming and yelling why are you doing this, who is this, what is this, my husband has been here with us, you are frightening me and my children, what is this and she would carry on boy. They finally said no let's leave him alone. I remember seeing those lights; I remember the noise, as I said vaguely. For years I asked my mother and daddy who was that, what was going on because I didn't know but they would never tell me until I got grown. My brother didn't even wake up. But they, that kind of thing they just never talked about. Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing you should never forget either. Speaker 2: Oh you don't. Believe it or not, really believe this or not when I started--when I get sick or something in the back of my mind I can just see that, I can see the lights. Do you understand what I mean? It still made that much of an impression on me. <Files\\HM\\HM_DeCosta-Willis_Miriam> - § 2 references coded  [2.81% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.81% Coverage. Immediately, let's see, Maxine and I had our babies. The next summer she and I applied to Memphis State University [later, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee], which had no, this is, this is 19--, let me see, I went there in 1956; this is 1957. The Supreme Court decision was 1954 [Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas (1954)], this is three years later. She and I applied, oh it created a furor, ahh the people were really upset. Finally, they decided we were not qualified, (laughter) in spite of the fact that I finished Wellesley, she had a Master's, she said, "I didn't even want to go there." It was just something that, you know, we had to do; so we were unqualified. In the meantime I was getting nightly calls from people who said they were on the football team and if I came out there, they were come and rape me. My husband and I lived on Lenow Alley [sic, Place, Memphis, Tennessee]. His parents lived on Walker [Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee] right across from the college [LeMoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee] and his father, bless his sweet soul, built us a little one bedroom, tiny little house on their back property, which faced onto the alley. So, one night we woke up and there was a gunshot through the window, people fired onto the thing. So, we were not afraid for ourselves, but we sent our kids, I sent-'cause I had two babies at the time and we sent them, the little girl up to Saint Louis to stay with his sister for a good part of the summer cause we were afraid for the children. So, you know, there were threats and what not. But we kept on, we were completely fearless. Then, in 1959 Russell ran for the County Commission [Shelby County Board of Commissioners], and all of us were really active; I mean door-to-door, campaigning, up late at night, up early in the morning, speaking in churches, rallying, just, we really just became caught up. Now, in that race we really did think blacks had a chance to win. Unfortunately, he was defeated and the other two, one of them was [HM Benjamin] Benny Hooks, one of them was a minister, Reverend [Roy] Love and so the three of them were defeated. But, we were not discouraged, we were determined and I think people realized at that point that there was this movement which was now manifesting itself in different ways. We went into the courts, we protested, we went into politics, you know, we began to do everything. Story_ID: 180033 Speaker 1: Ironically, even though Memphis State [later, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee] did not admit me in 1957, I was the first black teacher, faculty member there in 1957 so that would have been ten years later. Speaker 2: '67 [1967]. Speaker 1: '67 [1967], '67 [1967], right. So, '57 [1957] they denied, '67 [1967] and what happened that was kind of interesting how that happened, after I, after I couldn't get into Memphis State, realized I needed to get a master's. In 1959 I went to Johns Hopkins [University] in Baltimore [Maryland] and then came back. And when I came back, I was teaching at Owen Junior College [later, LeMoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee] in Memphis and our commencement speaker, I think, in about 1962 [1962] or '63 [1963] was the president of Memphis State and in his commencement address he said something about there will come a time when the university will be open, it was sort of vailed the way he said it. But he said, "And people need to be prepared for that opportunity," and it fell on ripe ground because at that point, what it was, it just re-- reinforced my desire to return to [John] Hopkins [University] to get the Ph.D. So, I happen to be the right person at the right time. Now, in the meantime, Uni--which is what is now the University of Memphis, at that time it was Memphis State University. We were denied in 1957, coming behind us, some students went into court and Memphis State was forced to open, I think in 1960 [sic, 1959], I don't remember the exact date. Once they opened, I went back and took courses in French in order to keep up my language skills, so I took a course there after it opened. And interestingly, the person who taught me she was from Mississippi and she spoke French with a southern accent. But I went back as a teacher, she was my office-mate. So, it's just kind of funny how things turn out. <Files\\HM\\HM_Dee_Ruby> - § 2 references coded  [2.80% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.80% Coverage We who had fought in World War II, fought with these expectations that the country was going to change its policy toward black folks. But when we got back home, we found that the country had no intention of changing its policy and went out of its way to let us know in many ways that that was not going to happen. There were certain cases where veterans were in serious trouble--young man, Isaac Woodard, down in [South] Carolina, you know, had his eyes gouged out while he was still in uniform on a bus [1946]. You know, two veterans in Monroe, Georgia, walking with their wives along a road in uniform, shot down by the Ku Klux Klan. A young man--Mapes (ph.), trying to vote in Georgia, you know, killed. And so the theater was always concerned about these things and as Ruby said, "Every night somebody would suggest a party somewhere,"--Rosalie Ingram, whose sons had killed a white man because the white man had molested her [1948], you know, and various other causes. Somebody being tried, somebody being lynched or somebody being put on the chain gang and we would meet to raise funds. Paul Robeson would be there and Orson Welles, and members of the theater. The theater took itself quite seriously.<Files\\HM\\HM_Dellums_Leola> - § 2 references coded  [0.68% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.68% CoverageAnd my daughter Piper went to UC-Berkeley, and she was a pre-med major, but she was also the star of the Shakespearean Festival, and she played--was in the War of the--they call it the War of the Roses-- Speaker 1: Emm-hmm.

And so she ends up, after she graduates from Berkeley, being--going to NYU; they wanted to put her in a very special program there called drama therapy, so she was able to combine being a doctor, you know, pediatrics, what she was focusing on, and her theater arts, 'cause she was so good, and she was part of the creative arts team there. And drama therapy is--well, what it is--through acting and performance, you help people--people act out certain kinds of things, especially like little kids may be victims of rape or any--of things that are very hard for people. So the, the drama therapist is able to do it through performance; it's a very--it's only seven people in that, in that--that they--a very small class that they accept to do that.

Chicago [Illinois] has lost so many children this year for no reason. I mean, the, the brutality of young people, the sense of hopelessness that leads them to just snuff out a life without a thought is horrifying to me. It is again I've just come across this theory that talks about wicked problems and I think this is a wicked problem that has at its root many different things. The lack of an education system, the changes in community, the profound failure of public education despite millions and millions of dollars from the private sector, from corporations, from foundations on an annual basis and it doesn't seem to get any better. So I am really very deeply troubled about the sense of possibility that--before our children. Their own sense of that possibility and how we see the world and what's going to be possible for them and especially as we move more and more into a globalized reality. You know, I heard a shocking statistic from a futurist who said that somewhere by the year 2025 something like 500 million men will live and die, never having had employment. That scares m to death. What do young boys do when they have no gainful meaningful place to direct their energies? So that's one of the things that I anguish deeply about. What can we do, how do we focus on that. At the same time I am deeply committed to advancing the position of women and girls in our society. I mean, the, the, the activities in Africa right now, the war practices that use women as the fodder for this, is abhorrent and so frightening to me that a culture or cultures that so revered family and community and elders and ancestors could do this to women, to children. You know, the Congo is just one example. What's happening in Guinea today and 2009 scares me to death and so that's the other thing that I would love to figure out how all of what I've done before can make a larger voice for that as we go forward. I'm very, very scared about--I wish I could be more hopeful but I'm very scared that, you know, we've got to come to some cataclysmic event before people will wake up and the fact that we're not standing up outraged about this and screaming about this every day. That our boys are being killed walking to school that women are being raped and beaten and abused in this way. That to me is something that has to change<Files\\HM\\HM_Dyson_Marcia> - § 1 reference coded  [2.13% Coverage]Reference 1 - 2.13% Coverage. Can I go back to 1969? A really pivotal moment in my life, I call it (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixty-nine [1969]? Okay. Speaker 2: Yeah. One of my best girlfriends went away to school and we had known each other since I was twelve years old. She went to Southern Illinois--Southern Louisiana University [sic. Southern University at Shreveport] in Shreveport, Louisiana. And so I took my second flight ever in my life down to Shreveport, Louisiana. And there--now I've gone through some black experiences, [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis is my icon. I go down to the South in the '60s [1960s] with an Afro, short pants, tight t-shirt with the peace sign, in a place that still---where people if you were black, had to dress up with some form of docili- being docile and with servility if you were going downtown. You had to be in your Sunday dress. But I didn't do that. In going to the stores, women would tell me, the white women would say, you know, "Baby, you aren't from here, are you?" Because I wasn't saying, "Yes ma'am." I wasn't giving them the proper southern props. And my best friend's grandmother lived way in the country. And she lived in the outback with the outhouse. And I decided one day being the adventurous Marcia [HistoryMaker Reverend Marcia Dyson], to take a bike ride on the country road. And on that country road looking at the trees and glistening, I went and stopped at a little country store, just like out of Spanky [George "Spanky" McFarland] and 'Our Gang,' the ragged screen fence, the little store and the eggs on ice and a little boy, black boy with a striped t-shirt was buying six eggs. Not even in a crate, just had six eggs, holding them and put them on the counter. And was looking in his pocket and threw the money on--put the money--was gonna put the money on the counter. And I told the little boy, "Boy if you giving the man your money, you can look the man in his eyes." And the little boy looked at me kind of head cocked like I was crazy. He threw that money on the counter, grabbed those eggs, put them whatever cloth, maybe his mother--and ran out the store. And again, this man in the store said like, "Girl, you must not be from here." I was like, "No, I'm not from here, I'm from Chicago [Illinois]." Now forget Emmett Till, forget--and I'm this big, black girl with the black experiences. I have seen some things, I have seen Fred Hampton killed. I know about Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and all this shuffling Negroes. This is not me, I'm this tough girl from the North. I am from Chicago. But I started riding that bike back home, back, bike back to her, her grandmother's house. And on the way there, a car full of rednecks came behind me. Then they were beside me. And they were saying things to me that when I saw that sun glistening on the trees, I thought my mother [Rosa Fields Smith] would never see me again because they were gonna take me into those woods and I'm sure rape me. A school bus came with white children. And I pedaled that bus [sic.] to keep up with the school bus and cross that bus in front of it perilously, rather be hit than be snatched in the woods by those white men. And the fear of every black person that I had seen in the movies, that trepidation, that southern fear, took hold of me and let me realize that like they said about Malcolm X compared to Martin Luther King, I saw the South on a soapbox, they saw it from the struggle. And it was my comeuppance. I started respecting the struggle more, the southern experience more. I understood the fear because it was in me. And it humbled me, you know, a great deal. I just thought that was, that was a very marker in my life as well, you know, of humbling. Speaker 1: Okay, I'm glad you told it. Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it (unclear).

The story that struck me most about his growing up in St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands] is that he was a kid when the United States purchased the Virgin Islands [Danish West Indies; U.S. Virgin Islands] from Denmark. That happened in 1917, so he was about ten. And he said the American soldiers came in and ran amuck. He said they were getting drunk, and raping women, and just carrying on. And he said he remembers a group of men meeting in his father's kitchen to talk about these American soldiers and what were they gonna do. And he doesn't remember what was said. He remembers the meeting and remembers the purpose of the meeting, which was to address these, you know, guys who were running amuck. He said well, the next day, an American soldier was found with his throat cut. And the day after that another was found. And he said this went on for two weeks. And he said that stopped. He said soldiers running amuck stopped. So my father to me--and again, this is through the eyes of a kid was the complete opposite of my mother. My mother came out of a segregated culture in society where you acquiesced, where you made nice, where you got off the sidewalk, you deferred.

And I said, "First of all, if you're doing an historical look at so called (gesture) interracial intimacies, you're talking about rape. You're talking about the master raping the slave. Okay, so let's not try to clean it up." So he was saying, "Well, you know--." What, what was his comment? He, he said something about what white families do. And I said, "They do this all the time routinely. It's inferred in everything they do. They don't have to come out and overtly say it; it's inferred in the neighborhoods that they live in, in the schools that they go to, where they send their kids to school. The expectation is there. We have to have the same expectations." I said, "And everybody doesn't have to do this." But then I had mothers who said, "You know, girl, I am--," she said, "I have a five year old."

And, so, he would read every script and then give his notes. Now, obviously, political correctness can be the enemy of comedy (laughter). Especially, psychological political correctness because, you know, he's super sensitive to this might offend women.

Why is nothing happening to improve conditions there or close them down? That's my question--how can someone be seven months pregnant when the records show that the doctor was there every month to examine her? Where were the nursesto check on her menstrual period? And who impregnated her? All a big mystery at this point, but I did the story, and then it was picked up by The Washington Post and nationwide because this is a story of the most vulnerable of us, and again she cannot speak, but I can. Story_ID: 156078 Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about the highlight of investigations here, and that, that serves as an unusual story (unclear). Speaker 2: It is, but I think it is not as unusual in occurrence as we might think. I just think that it's usually covered up or an abortion occurs, or something like that. Speaker 1: You did a positive thing. You uncovered it and possibly saved other people from this anguish and problems. Speaker 2: Well, look at the mother--the girl's mother who now has to think of raising a child, a baby, a child of rape. I mean there are just so many issues, and these issues are in our society, but this is a person who is very, very vulnerable and who was taken advantage of, who was raped. Legally, the investigators, the police are looking and hoping that through DNA, after the baby is born, they will find the person who sexually assaulted this girl. She can't speak. Speaker 1: So what else? What are some of the others? Speaker 2: There are a lot. Um--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: Is there any one story that you think is the most important written that we haven't discussed already? Speaker 2: I really like all the stories I do. I don't usually take them on if I don't like them. I think that there is a pattern in which I look at issues that affect vulnerable people. The women at the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District [of Greater Chicago], for example, talked about being sexually harassed, there were bomb threats. There were all kinds of issues with them when they spoke out with me, but change occurred somewhat. And there was education that occurred, and women tell me that their working conditions are there are better. We went undercover there to prove that this was going on, and that there was a hostile work environment. We went undercover at Ford Motor Company [in Chicago, Illinois] when the women there came to me to complain that they were being treated in a hostile way, and we found evidence of quite a hostile work environment. Lawsuits were filed. The women recovered money. You know, so again working conditions hopefully are better as a result of the work that we did. And I get thirty calls a day from people who have real, serious problems or from whistle-blowers who want to tell about issues that are going on, and want to tell about how government isn't doing what it is supposed to do, or how they are being defrauded by the private sector. Story_ID: 156079 Speaker 1: Now, do you have a story of a, of a lead that looked promising, that you got excited about it. You thought it was going to change people's lives only to find out it was a dead end? Speaker 2: I find that out very soon. I know how. Speaker 1: How do you know it? Speaker 2: Well, you know, basically when someone calls me, I check them out and there's not very much that I haven't heard of or seen and so I just know how to track things down very quickly, and I sometimes do not have any evidence. For example, the story that I just told you about happened at a place called the Alden Village Nursing Home in Bloomingdale, Illinois. Actually, three years ago, someone called me with a similar complaint of sexual abuse, but I couldn't prove it. It never was proven, so I put it in my files, and when I got this call this time, I went straight to that file and I said, "Now, this is call is pregnant. That's real evidence." So the story I wasn't able to do back then, now I can go and pick that up, and do it. In addition, I know how to gather the records from the Department of Public Aid, the Department of Public Health, and to find out what investigations have occurred from Medicare and Medicaid. All of these are public records that you can obtain from the Freedom of Information Act. Any citizen can do it, but I do know how to do that, and I fight with government almost every day to obtain records.<Files\\HM\\HM_Fields_Dorothy> - § 2 references coded  [1.21% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.21% CoverageSpeaker 1: But I'd always wanted a Ph.D. and so I must say something about my children before I-- Speaker 2: Well yes, yes.

And the first two or three weeks that she was there, there was a rape and there was a racial situation and immediately she turned to the black students because both she and her sister were graduates of Carrollton School of the Sacred Heart, which was all-white in Coconut Grove [neighborhood in Miami, Florida]. Speaker 2: Oh. Speaker 1: So this was really--she had not had that much contact with black students in school. But this racial incident was something that really, really concerned her and she decided that she was going to find out more about black history because she hadn't been very interested before to put it mildly.<Files\\HM\\HM_Flake_Elaine> - § 2 references coded  [2.28% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.28% CoverageSpeaker 2: I think we've given women a voice. I think that we are not afraid to talk about spousal abuse. We talk about rape, incest, things that brothers have never touched. I think that the women preachers, the woman preacher, has brought to the forefront some issues that were pushed to the back in our writing, in our preaching, in our programming. I just had a women's conference over in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. And I talked about--you know, we had classes on things like childlessness, raising children, overcoming divorce, getting rid of the anger, getting rid of the bitterness. I feel that ministry to women is what my generation in particular--Vashti [HistoryMaker Bishop Vashti McKenzie], Cecelia Bryant [Cecelia Williams-Bryant]--I think we have been very, we have been the trailblazers. And I hate to say it, because I'm not tooting my horn. But we have been the ones who have helped women deal with their issues, their feelings. We've not been afraid to talk about it, and we've not been afraid to deal with it, to help women to express themselves and hear what they need to hear in order to overcome divorce, in order to overcome years of rape or incest. We've not been afraid to do that. And I think that that has helped. One of my things about women's ministry and the ministry to children--I wanted to do a real strong prison ministry. And I brought a man in from the prison system, and I don't remember his name. But he said, "If you really want to do prison ministry, you need to start at school. If you really want to do prison ministry, you need to deal with women." He said, "Because if you can have children in a safe and positive environment, and then if you can help heal their mothers, then you will impact the prison industry, and it is an industry." So, that stuck with me. And I do feel that in healing and ministering to women, I'm helping the children. And I, of course feel that the Allen Christian School [Queens, New York] is an environment in which children are steered toward positive living and toward college. And so I think that those are two critical, critical, areas that my generation, especially with the--you know, I've been having women's conferences for twenty-seven years, for twenty-seven years, dealing with those kinds of issues; helping women to heal, helping women to be focused, helping them to see themselves as overcomers and victors. And every year I get feedback on Facebook, you know, "Life changing, I'll never be the same." And that's what you want.<Files\\HM\\HM_Flowers_Mary> - § 1 reference coded  [2.76% Coverage]Reference 1 - 2.76% CoverageIn regard to DCFS, the Department of Children and Family Services, I was just at awe one day to realize how many children were coming into the system and were wards of the state [of Illinois]. Now mind you, when I was growing up, if "Sally Sue" wasn't at home with her babies, it was just somebody's responsibility on the block. We, somebody was going to take care of those kids. It was no such thing as calling somebody or sending some child away. It was a community effort to raise children. It was a village. It took all of us. But there appeared to have been a new-found method, in my opinion, of creating dollars to bring to the state and that was to get children, because drugs, drugs was becoming rampant in our community and a lot of families were falling apart and so we started reading about horrible things, women burning babies and throwing babies out the windows and father sexually abusing children and selling their babies for dope. It was just a horrible situation. But if that wasn't bad enough, once they get into becoming wards of the state, they were once again in some cases sexually abused and misused and some kids were being sent to five and six and twenty different homes and each home they went to, it was worse than the other, they was further being, they were sexually abused at home with their biological parents and now there's these foster families. They were being sexually abused and there were other siblings there, other children there, that is not of the same family and each is sexually abusing each other and it was just a horrible, horrible situation and it was making me sick. I looked at the system and I said to myself, "Something is wrong here." There was no continuity. There was no way that families were really getting back together, there was no closure in what happened to the child. We were raising children to become greater predators. We were having them to leave DCFS [Department of Children and Family Services] and to become wards of the state again for the Department of Correction and it was a vicious cycle that, to me, that needed to be broken.<Files\\HM\\HM_Frazier_Frances> - § 5 references coded  [3.02% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.32% CoverageBecause that's where the passion was, that's where the call was.

And it was absolutely the most mind-changing experience of my life. Twenty-two days in Africa--I had never been to Africa. This was my first time, and I felt like I was from Nairobi, Kenya. I felt like I had gone home. It was amazing. I did not feel foreign. I did not feel like I was a black woman going home, you know. I just felt like this is where I belonged. I met the most incredible women, market women, bank presidents.

We went to, oh, we went to many receptions that probably would have never gotten into 'cause, you know, we were just women going to the conference.

Speaker 1: But his wife was very active in the women's community, and so it was just wonderful. Speaker 2: Now, was Wangari Maathai involved? Speaker 1: Yes, yes, but I didn't know her then. You know, I was just, I was just awestruck. Speaker 2: Did you hear her speak or anything or did you (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, I did hear her speak, yes-- Speaker 2: --find out what she was doing? Speaker 1: --yes, knew what she was doing. Speaker 2: She organized women and just, you know. Speaker 1: Right, but this was, so this was in '85 [1985]. So, she was just early starting out. But one of the things that happened maybe that first four or five days, even if you couldn't speak each other's language--'cause there were like fifteen thousand women from around the world, I mean literally around the world. No matter where you were from, there were certain things about you being a woman that you could share with a woman from anywhere, from Bangladesh, from Sweden, from Canada, from a small village, from Ghana, I mean just everywhere, small island off the, off the coast of South America. No matter where you were from, it was like--it was like all the men of the world had gone some place, agreed how they were gonna treat women, and then went back home because no matter where this woman was from, we all had the same stories about childbirth. We all had the same menstruation stories. We had all the same horrible stories about how we were treated in every place. You know, women were raped in every place, they were beat up in every place; they, they, women talked about their stories of misogyny, they talked about their rights of passage stories that were awful, just--and then somehow this gloriousness of being a woman and finding your own voice, and your own sense of agency, and not wanting to lose that. It was, it was miraculous. I came back home, and I was, I was so fired up. And what I said to my friends is, "When these--when I meet with these white women and we start talking about policy--" because at that time in Columbus [Ohio], the white women were starting to galvanize around women's health issues.

Speaker 2: How? Speaker 1: Maybe I'm getting it wrong, but tell me if I am. Speaker 2: Where? Speaker 1: In the area of domestic violence. White women organized around that issue and--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Here's what happened-- Speaker 1: --and it filtered to us. Speaker 2: When the white Women's Movement began, lesbian women and women who had been real victims of men started joining the movement and really and truthfully, it was not even women who were real victims. I take that back. When lesbian women joined the movement, their issues of, and issues of child abuse came out. Before then, those wealthy, white women were looking at economics solely. Lesbian women joined, issues of gender discrimination really came up, but also issues of child abuse, molestation, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, domestic violence, rape. All those issues really began to surface, and you are right for many black, activist women, domestic violence came up as a big issue. Child sexual abuse, incest, all of those issues really came up, and, truthfully, it was the Women's Movement and the voice of lesbian women that created children's rights. We didn't have real children's rights back then, and that's when children's rights had--so if there, if there was a huge contribution then, of course, it was the fact that the rights of children was born as a result of that Women's Movement. But, you know, there are a lot of thinkers, especially thinkers of color and women thinkers of color, who believe that the Women's Movement and the white Women's Movement was a--was--what's the word I want to use? It circumvented the rest of the Civil Rights Movement because the Civil Rights Movement was really perceived as being a black movement for the most part. And in our community, black men were like lifted up. They got the jobs. They found their voic. They found their place, short-lived, but, in fact, did. I believe had we been politically allowed to continue, even after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, if we had begun to continue to take that force and continue the work, we would have heard the voice of black women in a way we would have never have heard it. And it wouldn't have been just singular black women like [HM] Angela Davis. There were a number--C. Delores Tucker. There were a number of women but singular in their voice. I believe that we would have heard the collective voice. You'd have seen more sisters in the streets, not rioting but reclaiming our families and members of our families. We would have had a great voice, and I just think it was political. This is just my own exp- you know, sometimes I'm a conspiracy theorist. I just believe that our movement was circumvented by the white Women's Movement. I believe that. Speaker 1: Do you think it siphoned off energy from black women that they would have used had the issue still been civil rights? Speaker 2: I think it was a political maneuver. That's what I think because had the voice, collective voice of black women been allowed, politically, to rise up, we would have brought the other sisters of color with us, and it would not have become a white Women's Movement after that. <Files\\HM\\HM_Fry_Rita> - § 2 references coded  [0.98% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.98% CoverageSpeaker 1: Harold Washington was elected here in Chicago in 1983. Did the atmosphere change any when Harold Washington was elected? Or did you see, did you notice any difference in-- Speaker 2: Not in terms of the crime rate or the police department. Because remember, the city of Chicago is one city within the County of Cook. And so, the State's Attorney represents the County of Cook. And so, you're talking about crime across... over a hundred municipalities. So, the State's Attorney was always very strict in terms of the way the State's Attorney's Office was laid out. Only the first chair in a courtroom--meaning the most senior State's Attorney in a courtroom--could determine the level of plea bargains in certain kinds of cases--crimes of violence, murder, rape, home invasion. That was when the law changed as well, to make it a Class X, so those crimes got greater penalties and no probation, which meant those cases had to be tried. So, that whole law and order mentality made for a more tense time, because you had cases that suddenly--where maybe you could have plea-bargained for something less than prison time--now automatically carried a prison sentence. So, unless the State's Attorney was willing to reduce the charge, you were going to be going to trial on these cases, because there was really no alternative. So, you didn't sense a change, in terms of the way the police or the State's Attorney dealt with crime. You simply saw under Harold Washington a greater awareness about how it was impacting minorities.<Files\\HM\\HM_Gillespie_Marcia> - § 2 references coded  [1.98% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.98% CoverageSpeaker 1: Uh huh.

And he's walking down, walking along the wall. And the editor is explaining--and then they come to the photograph of Eldridge Cleaver. Graves went ballistic. "We're not having a convicted rapist in Life Magazine. You know, "How dare you?" Blah, blah, you know. "He's nobody's leader, he's no new spokesperson." Blah, blah. "He's a convicted rapist", or whatever, you know. And the next thing I know, everybody is looking at me. The editor's looking at me. It's like it was if I was the only one who thought that, you know, Cleaver should be part of it. And I finally said, "Look, I don't like that he's a convicted rapist. So, that does not necessarily mean that therefore he is not a spokesperson or a leader." You know, I said, "We have had leaders of nations who have done worse", you know. "And it is not up to you to tell black people who they should follow. That's not who you, that's not your place either, Mr. Graves", you know. "And there are a lot of black people in this country who consider him to be a legitimate voice for their concerns. I thought he was going to have an apoplectic fit. And then he, you know, he yelled some more. And I said, "Look, Dr. Franklin, John Hope Franklin, was supposed to be the advisor on this, this thing that they were doing." I said, I said, "So, why don't you ask, speak to Dr. Franklin? You know, who am I? I'm a nobody. Ask Dr. Franklin, you know, what his opinion is." And I remember Graves stormed out of the room or whatever. The editor I remember said to me, "Well, dear, you know, if you had thought that maybe there was going to be a job for you at Life Magazine, I think you can forget it." It was true. You know, I thought that I was really was going to get to be a reporter there. But after that incident, I knew I was mud. The upshot was Graves talked to Dr. Franklin, and Dr. Franklin told him almost essentially what I'd said.

And I had been reading--I read a lot--but I had been reading John Hersey, and John wrote a book--it's really--it's still an interesting book to me--called 'The Child Buyer." And what they did was they had this guy who goes around buying children. They're looking for geniuses. And it started of it's like, "Okay I want to buy," you know, "you got a son or a daughter, you know, I give you one hundred thousand dollars for your kid if you'll let me rear him." And people are like, "No," you know, "I'm not going to sell my kid for one hundred thousand dollars."

I was like, "Yeah, I need a new refrigerator." Because people could understand--it was really--it's a great book. But I don't know what affect that book had on the Ford Foundation but they were looking for geniuses and Mrs. Delaney--Barbara Brookes was our librarian and Mrs. Stokes who's my French teacher, all said to grandmother, you know, "There's a new program and Nikki should take the test." Grandpapa wanted to go to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and he wanted me to go to Philadelphia with him, so we got on a train and we went to Philadelphia because my Aunt Ann was there, and we saw, you know, Liberty Bell and did all of that.

It's a shame that we don't have him, but if we have to lose him we've got his work.

You know, actually I came here to Chicago [Illinois] a couple of years ago because people don't bother you. I wanted to hear Bobby 'Blue' Bland.

But if you look at the blues, what's the butt of all of those jokes? A bad woman, right? But we now have the maturity to look at the blues as what it really is and recognize that this is a metaphor. And we look at it not as how come the black man always is bitching about the black women, but we look at it as the metaphor that it is. Rap deserves that same respect. And it's easy because in the heat of the moment everybody can look at it, "Well, it's angry. Well it does this--." Well what it is, it's a legitimate voice. And so, it's been around, what are we into almost the twentieth year. It's not going any place. It's on Broadway [New York, New York].

When I began my gender explorations, I actually began by looking at what feminist were doing--some of the issues that feminists were raising in theology. So I was looking essentially at feminist theology. But as I was studying the work of feminist, you know, tensions of theologians, you know, I was increasingly struck by the lack of me, the lack of my presence, you know, the lack of African American female presence as I studied feminist analysis, the whole notion that women's experience has been ignored historically in the doing of theology and in the doing of any other disciplines as well and the notion that women's experience really essentially has been defined by men and in the interest of men. I found all that to be true, but that's not the whole story. I was not finding African American women's presence in what women were saying. In other words I was studying white women's experiences as a source for doing feminist theology. So what that did for me then is that it told me that I needed to go and look someplace else. So that sent me to slave and ex-slave narratives to look at African American women's contributions in the area of defining African American women's reality and African American women's reality in our understanding of religion. In my research I was struck by a couple of slave, ex-slave narratives, and I really do not remember, I really need to look this up. I don't remember if these were two separate narratives or the same narrative. I think there were two separate narratives. But one narrative--in one narrative the slave--ex-slave was talking about the devotional life of the slave--of the mistress of the plantation. And she noted that the mistress would, every day at a certain time, she would sit in the parlor and read the Bible, do her Bible reading, devotional reading for the day. And then there's another slave narrative, I think the second slave narrative that I read where the slave or ex-slave was talking about having been beaten, having been ordered beaten by the foreman because the mistress had ordered the foreman to beat the slave, because the mistress had just discovered that the master of the plantation had sexually abused--had raped the slave woman. I call it rape; the text may not have used for the word rape, but it referenced sexual relation with the slave woman. Speaker 1: Who was she? Speaker 2: I call it rape because if you don't got freedom then you don't have the freedom to say no, you know, so it's rape. Well I couldn't reconcile those two narratives. One narrative talking about a woman sitting--a mistress sitting in the parlor reading the Bible as her regular devotional life, and the other narrative talking about the mistress on the plantation ordering the woman to be beaten because she got angry and upset and I guess in her disempowered state, she couldn't do anything to her husband, so she wanted the slave woman beaten. Story_ID: 187180 Speaker 1: And I kept asking myself, what was that woman reading in that Bible? What was that Bible telling her about what goes on outside that parlor that she was sitting--that parlor window that she was sitting in front of? What was that Bible telling her about how slave women, black are being treated on her plantation, even if this is a different (unclear), that's not the point. But the question what was the Bible telling her about slavery, about (unclear) slavery, how a people are systemically dehumanized, disenfranchised, disempowered, dehumanized day after day. What was that bible telling her? What that left me postulating then is that there's a radical difference between the experiences of the daughters of slaves and the experiences of the daughters of slaveholders.

And as far back as I can remember, my grandmother was, she was a little lighter skin than you and she had reddish brown hair. Now mama [Millie Williams Armstead] says that, as a child growing up, that grandma had hair hanging way down her back, long hair hanging down her back. But I don't remember her in that manner--I remember her as a child when I was about nine or ten. She had short hair, very much like an Afro, and folk weren't even wearing them back there then. And mama said she guessed it was a nervous condition--said her mother used to just pick at her hair all the time. I'm sure it was nerves, but grandma said that when she was a girl, fourteen years of age, said Mammy [maternal great-grandmother] came and got her. And I can think, as being her child, what I said to my grandmother, you know, children, as, as Art Linkletter used to say, children can say some of the darndest things.

And when the master--I mean, when Mammy carried her up there to, to the master's house, he told Mammy, "You just leave her and go on, and you come back in about an hour, and you get her." And grandma said--she didn't call it rape then. She said all the things that he did to me, and said I've got--I had an uncle named Edgar [ph.], and he was just a pretty man. She said all the things that he did to me--said that old no-nation son of mine, but she would call him that, but he wasn't responsible for who he was--Uncle Edgar, my mother's oldest brother. She said that she referred to him as an old, no-nation child--said that he's the result of what the old master did to me. And she hated white people--she couldn't stand them. And she was just fourteen years of age. And then Mammy brought up Uncle Edgar. And when he was a little boy about six years of age, the master told her, told Mammy to, "Bring that boy up there to my house, and he's going to be my houseboy"--well, it was his child, see. And so, the master just about reared Uncle Edgar up there in his house--bringing in wood and splitting wood, and that sort of thing. I don't know whether they let Uncle Edgar to go to school or not because he didn't stay with grandma and grandpa, my mother's mother and father, but that's, that was a story that she told me. <Files\\HM\\HM_Grevious_Audrey> - § 2 references coded  [1.37% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.37% Coveragewhat was your neighborhood like when you were--did it change at all or--? Speaker 2: It was, it was a pretty nice neighborhood. There were restaurants and things there. Of course the children weren't allowed to go in the restaurants. Like now they can go wherever they want to, we couldn't because we knew the people who owned them and, and they knew our families. So it was off limits. But I think if I had to really describe, I would say that it was a safe neighborhood simply because everybody looked out for one another. The most horrible thing that I can remember during that time and, and, and which has caused me to have some feelings about rape and child abuse, is that when I was about eight or nine, I found a little girl crying on Fourth Street between some houses that had been sexually abused. And I picked her up. I did not know at the time what it was, I just thought she had fallen and hurt herself because she was crying. And I'm packing her around the corner to bring her to some of the women who, you know, lived there, cause they looked out--everybody looked out for everybody else's child. And it was many, many years later that I found out what had really happened to her because they quickly took her from me and, and, and took her to the doctor. We had a doctor that lived on Third Street, Dr. Wendell (oh.). And they took her, ran there and took her to him. And it was much, much later that I found out, you know what had happened. So there was that closeness in the family that everybody was your mother and your father.<Files\\HM\\HM_Grimshaw_Jacquelyne> - § 2 references coded  [2.34% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.34% CoverageSpeaker 2: Oh, Larry, that's a, that's a hard question to answer. Well, let me just give you an example of why it's difficult. While I was at the city of Chicago, I came into my office one day and there were all these people there, most of whom I knew, you know, sitting in the waiting area of my office. And so I go into my office, and I had my assistant come in and say why are these people here, 'cause I knew I didn't have any appointments at the time. And she said they're sitting in. What do you mean they're sitting in? Well, they're sitting in waiting to talk to you. Well, why do they wanna talk to me? Well, they can't talk to the mayor, and they can't talk to anybody else, and so they wanna talk to you. Well, why do they wanna talk to me (laughter)? So she said they won't tell me. So I said okay, so I came out. And you know, turns out these are people from, from the Center for Neighborhood Technology. The majority of 'em are from the center. So I go out and so I said you know, like, what's up? Why are you here? What do you need? What do you want? And so they had said--you know, one of things that in the, you know, the, the, the [Harold] Washington Administration, or at least the Washington campaign had produced these Washington papers, which were essentially policy positions that the, the candidate for mayor was espousing that he would do in the government. And so one of those issues as dealing with abandoned housing. At the time, you know, the city of Chicago was having this epidemic of buildings being abandoned, you know, people living in them, you know, without heat, without water, that, you know, it got--conditions got so bad, they were condemned by the courts as unlivable. People would move out, then the brick thieves would come in and start taking the thieves and the--and taking the bricks, and then you'd have a dangerous building. It was also, you know, these open buildings became safety hazard because people would be dragged into 'em and raped, and beat, and robbed and things of that sort. So it was really a problem in various communities around the city. And so the Center for Neighborhood Technology had, had, had this, you know, strategy for dealing with these abandoned buildings that they got included in the Washington papers. So, you know, the mayor was in office. You know, they were coming down to City Hall to see how to go about implementing it. Well, they couldn't talk to anybody. They went to the housing department, and nobody there would talk to them. They went to the building department. Nobody there would talk to 'em. So it was just this thing that everywhere they got re--rebuffs, so they came to my office. And I said well, why did you come to my office? I have nothing to do with housing, and building inspections, and housing court and all the rest of that. And they said well, you know the mayor. The mayor will listen to you, so we need you to go tell the mayor that we need to implement this program. I said all right (laughter). So, you know, I said okay, tell me exactly what the program is. So they--we sat down, and they told me what they were proposing to do, and I said okay, all right. So I go down to the mayor and I said, you know, these folks are sitting in my office, you know. I need to do something with them. You know, what do you want me to do? So he listened to my sad tale, and he says call up [HM] Brenda Gaines. Well Brenda Gaines was the Commissioner of Housing. And he said tell Brenda Gaines to meet with him, and that this is a program we should do it, and tell her to do it. I said okay, that's cool. And he says and you work with her. I said mayor, I don't know anything about housing. He says well learn. That's the way he was. You know, for him, no is not an answer, so I was not going to get out of this, you know, so I could--may as well not even try. 'Cause when he said do it, that was it; that was then my job, to learn about housing, to get Brenda Gaines and the housing department to pay attention to these folks. Story_ID: 81405 Speaker 1: So out of this came a program that the center called Neighborhood Early Warning System, NEWS. And with the Neighborhood Early Warning System would do, they, there were eight indicators that they had figured out would lead to eventually--if all these indicators, you know, were lined up in place, this housing would ended up being abandoned and pretty much demolished. And so the, the complicating thing about these indicators is some of them were, were from departments that the city had some control over, like the Water Department. So, for example, if a building, you know, had their water cut off because the nonpayment of water bill, that was an indication it was heading to disaster. If the building had a fire, and the building was not repaired, you know, or, you know, the people were still trying to live in a building with a fire, obviously that was a problem. If the building had a lot of housing code violations, or when--were, you know, assigned to housing court, you know, that was another indication. So, you know, there are all of these things that were indictors. Some of the things that, the, the, the city does not have control over were taxes. If the taxes were in arrears, well, that's a Cook County Tax Collector. So, you know, we had nothing to do with that, but that was another indicator. Another one was housing court itself, you know, that, that was, again, the county court system, the city had no involvement with that. So these indicators were a combination of city indicators and county indicators. And so, you know, what the, what the center wanted to do was to get access to all of this data and put it in a database, and make it available to communities, particularly the community development corporations because they had the ability to intervene and, and actually be named receivers of buildings that were in danger of, of going down this, this potential line of, of abandonment. And so they could go to housing court and be named a receiver to then get control of the building, and you know, use the, the rents to start, you know, ameliorating some of these problems. So we got it in place; the program is working, etc. I then go to the Center for Neighborhood Technology, NEWS is operating, and what does it end up being? My program. So I get to the center, and now I'm responsible for maintaining the relationships with the city to keep the NEWS system operating. So, you know, it was, it was then seeing NEWS from the other side of the street as actually, you know, working with the Department of Planning, working with the water department, and working with the housing and so forth to maintain this flow of data that would allow us to, to have an up-to-date database so that, you know, community development corporations could, in fact, you know, get these buildings before they ended up being abandoned and being victimized by brick thieves and things of that sort. So, you know, that's an example by--on both sides is that: one, being in government, I was able to create a program. On the other hand, being at the Center [Center for Neighborhood Technology], was able to take that program and now we have expanded it, and you know, it's online, and you can go there right now. You know, so there's a lot of improvements we got to make, to make, yeah, this information more usable by community development corporations, by developers, by individuals, etc. so that, yeah, we can maintain the housing stock and, and not lose it. Story_ID: 81406 Speaker 1: So, you know, which was better, to create it or to operate it, to implement it, and keep improving on it? I don't know, Larry, it's, you know, it's, that's a tough question. I mean I have, I have been able to see the difference that I could make in the government, as well as, as being, you know, in a nonprofit sector. You know, in, in both, in both positions, you know, I've had to organize people, you know, involve people in what, in what we were doing. You know, at, when I was at the city it was important that the community stayed with us, and that's the way we convinced the city council, the, the General Assembly, as well as the Congress that here are some programs that needed to, to be implemented for the people. <Files\\HM\\HM_Guidry_Carolyn> - § 2 references coded  [2.00% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.00% CoverageSpeaker 2: I think probably the one that that that stands out in my mind most is the event of the, the black oh, shoot, I'm blocked, I'm blanking on his-- Speaker 1: The young man that was killed? Speaker 2: Well, well that during the Civil Rights Movement but even earlier than that there was a black man who was electrocuted after many years of appeals and they (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh right. Speaker 2: --for raping a white woman [Willette Hawkins] who-- Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: --when actually it wasn't a rape, he had been seeing her on the side, she was married, they got caught, [Willie] McGee, I think, I think his name was. Speaker 1: I think you, I think you might be right. I've heard this story and-- Speaker 2: Yeah, right. Speaker 1: --it was, the way it was told to me, now tell me if you remember this 'cause you were living there, there at the time. They said that when he was electrocuted the lights actually dimmed in the homes-- Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: --and stuff. Speaker 2: Yes. I and because actually, and, it he, and I guess it was the first time that they had appealed for, it was a number of years from his actual arrest and trial to the execution. And probably the first time that a black man had ever been able to be processed even through the appeals system. But there was ample evidence that that it was not a rape but the fact was it was a black man involved with a white woman and it had to be nothing less than, than a rape. And so I remember when he was electrocuted for that. For me that, that was the first time I remember I understood the horror of segregation and Jim Crow. Speaker 1: And the interesting thing about that too is that, on some level and as crazy as it is, that's some kind of a victory that he actually got on trial, right? Speaker 2: It is. It is. And it (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Even an unfair trial. Speaker 2: Right. And even though people, blacks in Mississippi knew what the outcome would be and I guess I must have been five or six years old, I wasn't that old, but just old enough to understand that something wrong was happening here, something was going on. And I can remember the conversations between the adults, the fact that they would allow him even to appeal through the process was new because ordinarily, he would have just been hung on the site. And-- Speaker 1: Now-- Speaker 2: --and nothing would have been done about it. But the fact that they allowed him to remain in jail and to go through the appeal process of trial and then electrocuted legally was in itself a victory. <Files\\HM\\HM_Guy_Jasmine> - § 4 references coded  [0.96% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.36% Coverage Speaker 1: So, the show ['A Different World'] went on-- Speaker 2: There're some not so good stories.

You mention [HM] Maulana Karenga who, at that time, was huge. Kwanzaa was very, very big. Can you describe your evolution in concept from Nia and in alignment with Karenga, too, your thinking when you got to "Barbershop, Bibles, and BET?" Speaker 2: So, I was in college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina] and doing all this activism, and, or what I understand to be activism, campus protests, you know, kind of campus as a laboratory, all of that is around race. We are identified, in fact, we threw campus Kwanzaa every year, we saw ourselves as bringing racial presence to the campus. I did, I did almost nothing with women's organizing on campus. Now, I took women's studies classes, I read bell hooks, but I, in my actual work I did almost nothing around womens'--unless it was black womens--work with an emphasis, probably, on the racial aspect of it. It was really in graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina] when I started to identify with two important things; one, that I was a rape survivor which, although it occurred before I ever even left to go to college, I'm really rare--I don't know that I ever really talked about it in college. I certainly hadn't even disclosed it to my own parents [William M. Harris, Sr. and Diana Gray] until senior year, maybe even, either senior year of college or first year of graduate school before I even disclosed that it had happened, even though it happened when I was fourteen. I just did not talk about it with any--when I was 14, I told one person, a friend, and no one else until I was about 20. And so, as I started engaging both my own kind of personal healing around it, started to disclose it, started to think of it as part of my identity as being a sexual assault survivor, that draws you into doing women's work in a different way and I also started reading a lot of work by African American women who were rape survivors and, of course, almost all of us are survivors of rape at the hands of men who are black, because everyone is most likely to be sexually assaulted within the context of their own race. It's not that men are most, that black men are most likely to be rapists, but they are most likely to be the rapists of black women, just as white men are most likely to be the rapists of white women. The--"We must save the endangered black man, we must rally all together, our unity is more important than anything else"--starts to fall apart when you are willing to be very honest about the amount of intra-racial gender violence, and it was something that even though I had experienced it, I just hadn't dealt with it or thought about it, or theorized about it, or put it in the context of my work, and once I started doing that, it forced me to say, "Okay, how do I love the race? How do I talk about this notion of black masculinity and black manhood, but have a place to talk about what happened to me at the hands of a black man." And, the more that I did that and the more that I started, you know, you start just following, I try to get my students to read this way--you read one thing and that person mentions something and then you can read that person since you are kind of, you know, doing this intellectual history just through reading what the people that you're reading are reading--and when I started todo that, all of a sudden I realized, Oh, my God! Every time people would say, I could remember conversations in college where we would say how bad slavery was, in part because black women were raped, and if black women were raped that meant black men could not protect their women. I could remember these conversations as though the main victim of rape is the man, whose manhood is somehow damaged by this. I can remember us saying in Kwanzaa, like, "We must protect the black woman who is our community's greatest resource." Ahhh--she is the community, like, push her over as the resource in part, because black sororities and fraternities come out of an era of uplift. There is also a lot of weird, like gendered stuff that goes on about being "the backbone," so even though Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] is this black woman's organization, also sometimes reproduces a respectability politics that still has a relatively constrained notion for who black women are, and so you learn those things as mantras that you repeat because you're proud of the organization, and it wasn't until I start reading some of the critiques that I was like, "Oh, yeah, woah. That is a problem." So it really, it was this kind of personal moment of changing my identity from, like pan-Africanist, nationalist, black girl, to pan-African nationalist black girl rape survivor, to "Oh-wait a minute, that is going to have to change my whole analysis," and so by the time, and, I'm also by the way encountered Wahneema Lubiano, who made me read a whole bunch of other things and also just made me stop saying certain kinds of things and I met my very best girlfriend [Blair Kelley], who is the second half of my brain and she has never been anybody's nationalist nothing, and so she critiqued and she challenged. She is a historian, actually a dean at North Carolina State [University in Raleigh, North Carolina] right now, so, as a historian she would push back against some of the kind of ahistorical, racial things I would say and so some of it was my identity, some of it was my friendship, some of it was what I was reading, but, you know, by the time five years of graduate school passed, I had a very, very different world view. Story_ID: 564909 Speaker 1: So I want to go back, you mention that you are a rape survivor and you didn't tell your parents [William M. Harris, Sr. and Diana Gray] for a long time. Speaker 2: I don't, still never told my father. I mean, he watches the show so I guess he knows, but I never said it to my father, yeah. Speaker 1: Did your family know this person? Speaker 2: He was our neighbor, which is why I did not tell, so this was after we had moved and my mother had gone through a lot to buy the home, so this is the first time we lived in a single family home. It was the first home that she herself had purchased and bought, and the fact we built it. Not a fancy house, just very basic, but it was the home that she built. A nice little, you know, neighborhood, still two, my two best friends in high school [Thomas Dale High School in Chester, Virginia] lived in that same neighborhood. This man, his backyard, so we were a corner lot, his backyard abutted ours, and he was a father, African American man, married, was a father of two children and lived there all through my high school, (not my, he wasn't there in high school) high school years, college years. I finally told, I might be getting this timing a little wrong, I think I told junior or senior year of college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina]. I told my mom and then, and it was because she kept bugging me. Some mail for him had come to our house and she kept asking me, I was home on summer or Christmas break, and she kept asking me to take it over to him and I wouldn't and I'm not, I mean, I'm rebellious but I'm not disobedient like that and she could not under--and finally, she was like, "Take the mail over!" and I spilled why I wouldn't. Of course, at that point, so much time had passed no one at that point was talking and we just didn't do anything legal, but then, and this now, I'm sure I've got the timing right on this. This, the second year of graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina], and this is hard to believe but he actually hit me in the face. He was walking. In certain ways this galls me even more because, like, all right, but I was standing in my front yard, it was Christmas, I was coming home. He was walking his dog past our front yard. The dog comes into the yard to use the bathroom, which I just saw as --- and so I screamed at him to get his dog off my yard because--Jesus!-- and then he screamed back, came into the yard, we got into each other's face, and he hit me. So I called the police for that! Right? End up in court and telling the judge who this person is to me, what he had done to me, and the judge, (unclear) judge says, "well, I mean, I don't know anything about that, if there is any report of anything like that; this just sounds like neighbors and so go home and be nice to each other." And, basically you know my mom's enjoyment of that neighborhood ended from the time that she knew, so she had enjoyed and loved her neighborhood, she is a gardener, she always loved to garden, but like her garden was the line of their property and so it really, so, part of the reason I never told was because sure enough, once I did and once that happened, it just made the whole experience for everyone there very, very ugly and awful, and it wasn't long after that, after the court thing happened, because even though the judge did nothing, his wife heard me say what I said and people who rape teenagers, grown men who do that, are not single-time perpetrators. It's never true, and I suspect that as the wife she also understood that he had probably perpetrated in other circumstances, whatever those were, because very shortly thereafter their marriage broke up and the family moved, but yeah, and again, I talk about being a survivor on air, but I have never had a conversation with my father about it.<Files\\HM\\HM_Hines_Bea> - § 2 references coded  [0.27% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.27% Coverage Speaker 2: And I was, I did quite a few stories on police, you know, on police brutality.

And that was one of those times that was like you know when I think about sort of like that water shed moment of how like you're in high school and you're like going through all the dorky, awkward high school stuff, like it all came together for me after that retreat. And there were all sorts of things that they did to us during that time, very psychological but very effective. Like one part of the retreat was a night where they had all of your parents write a letter to you of every kid and then they read the letters out loud. And it was like, you know, everything you could possibly imagine you know from parents saying you know I know my alcoholism has been a problem to parents saying you know things, you know my sickness or whatever it is, things that you necessarily didn't know about your friends, and just you know every child in the room was undone. I mean it was like you were a puddle. You just couldn't even--and it just sort of gave you such an appreciation for all the issues that people around you were confronting that you really didn't understand because you only saw them a certain way, a certain part of their life, a certain part of their day. And the other thing that they did was then everyone who had ever gone through the retreat, they had write you letters. So you'd go back to your room that night and they had a big huge envelope on your bed and your bed was filled with letters of people who knew you who had written to you from high school and your teachers. And it was one of those moments where the whole headline that they gave us during that period was you know they said that most kids are really insecure and you know doubting of themselves and lacking confidence. And the line from the retreat was "I'm loveable because God doesn't make junk." And we had these buttons that we wore. And you know in hindsight it sounds really hokey but it wasn't. And so then when you sat down with these letters where people like basically poured out their heart to you and told you why you were so special to them, it was like you know it was beyond touching, beyond you know anything I ever imagined. And then when we came home, we'd been gone for two days and they, you know you're just, you're worn out emotionally. And they--one thing I should also say, they had each teacher get up and give a talk about their life and other students did the same thing. And their talk would end and begin with a song and then it would, they would tell you things that you just, no teacher had ever told you before about, you know things that had happened to them or what have you. And you know from one teacher telling us how her sister was raped and killed you know all sorts of things. So again it's just emotionally, emotionally draining. And basically them trying to prove to us, life is just hard. There are things that are beyond your control. You got to pick yourself up. You're a good person. You have to strive to continue to be a good person, that sort of thing, that kind of message. We come home and they say you know we got to pick up all of your stuff in the library. The library at Ignatius is at the top of the building. You walk into the room and they had the music playing from someone's lecture and your entire family there to pick you up. It's like you know, and you walk in and they're all just clapping for you cause they know you'd gone through this like really emotional experience and so then everyone starts crying. I mean just like, it's just this you know well of tears, buckets, buckets, buckets, and just amazing. And then to do that in high school, that's a very significant memory that I have from Ignatius, significantly--significant. References 3-4 - 0.60% Coverage Speaker 2: [Saint] Ignatius [College Prep, Chicago, Illinois] had a lot of--they would throw us--the Jesuits are known for being sort of the politically incorrect priests, order of priests within the Catholic faith. And they would throw us these like misses, these like mind benders and then they would make us figure them out. And they would have us challenge each other in class and they'd have them all the time. I mean like all--this one I remember till this day, my religion teacher he said a woman, she's seventeen years old, she's walking down the street. She's abducted. No, I'm sorry. A woman, she's seventeen years old, she has mental problems. She's put in a mental institution, she's raped. Does she keep the child or do they abort the child. So we all sit there and we say they abort the child, there's no question about it. And he looks at us and he says you just killed me. And we were like, oh my god. And so any kind of like, where things weren't so clear, they would try to make us push ourselves harder to think about sort of repercussions of our views, so that we could think responsibly. Like they were giving us information but they wanted us to think responsibly about that information. So race, lots of discussions, lots of discussions around really controversial themes in the Catholic faith, euthanasia to abortion, to--and they which I really respect, it was like my upbringing at home even though on certain issues I told you my mother [Dorothy Brown] was absolutely non-negotiable around values. <Files\\HM\\HM_Hughley_Stephanie> - § 2 references coded  [1.43% Coverage]Reference 1 - 1.27% CoverageSpeaker 1: Shape note singing and lining in hymn singing. Shape notes, do, do, do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do, do-do, re-re, you know, shape note singing. I learned about lining in hymn singing, that that's what my [maternal] grandfather [Ciscero Bradley] and all those people down in--on that Alabama farm in Luverne, outside of Luverne, Alabama. Rural route box number. And that old church when one person would start singing--and then everybody would sing right behind him. I learned so many things from Worth Long. From folks at the Smithsonian Institution [Washington, D.C.], you know, about African American history. I knew my grandmothers, but I didn't know my grandmothers' grandmothers', and where they came from, and, and I didn't under--I didn't know about the Great Migration, you know. I didn't know about--I didn't even care to know about all that history going back and how a slave owner had raped the enslaved women in the house and, and how my family went from dark, dark black to white. I didn't even care about any of that until I got into the National Black Arts Festival and I started to meet the people who were rooted and grounded in the history. And I was amazed at how many people who live in Atlanta [Georgia] have never been to the Sea Islands. They didn't know about the African retention of culture in those Sea Island people. And so I saw this incredible opportunity to bridge Africa and African American history in a way that had not been really done in this country before, through music, dance, theater, film, visual art, performing art, literary art and folk art. People came from all over the world, and they came from all over this country. And they converged around this incredible celebration. I started working March or March of 1987 and we did the first festival in July of 1988. It was the end of July, beginning of August. And boy, we decided the first festival was gonna focus on the Harlem Renaissance. And it was funny because when they decided to call the National Black Arts Festival, the only thing I would have still done differently with that title. A lot of people say you shouldn't call it black, you should, you know. Only thing I would have changed would have been the International Black Arts Festival. Because there's no way that you could tell the story about African American people and not begin in Africa. So I have these incredible opportunities to travel to Africa for the first time. I got off that plane and kissed the ground in Ghana and in Senegal where I saw the people who were looking like my [paternal] grandmother's [Zella Smith] people who I decided were from Sapelo Island in Georgia, all the way up to today. I saw the continuum of African people, and I realized that we as African Americans, we were the most ignorant about it all because we had been so brainwashed into believing that Africa was the dark continent. When I got there, it was the brightest continent I'd ever seen in all of my travels. It was the most colorful, the most brilliant, the most, the most incredible sounds and smells and, and I realized that this festival was important. That it was important for us to do it. It was important for us to have this moment in time to go back and reflect and, and build the bridge. And build the bridge not only from African to this country, but from this country into our everyday lives. To bring the art back to the people. And I realized that art was just this very marginalized term in this country. That art was a picture on a wall. An artist was a singer or a painter. But in fact art was just one expression of culture, and that this was really about culture and creativity. If you boil it all down to its basic common denominator, it's about culture and creativity. 'Cause everybody has culture and everybody has creativity. And art was just one manifestation of those two things. And so for me you know, that's why I took on the National Black Arts Festival and I guess that's why I'm still here.Reference 2 - 0.16% CoverageSpeaker 2: Well I was thinking about, you know, my family's history.

I'll just give you an example of the, the cruelty of the, the place, the shocking cruelty. There was, the, they have classification systems in prisons. And the classification system by type of crime, violent, those kinds of characteristics. The Georgia State Prison had a policy of placing the young inmates, the first offenders, in with the homosexuals, because they said they didn't fight as hard as the older prisoners, and it was a way of pacifying the population. So I got, this is outrageous, I got a letter one time, an anonymous letter from someone who said there was a young inmate who had been viciously gang raped in the dormitory and that this inmate was writing to say couldn't we help to try to get this kid out. So I called for the--an opportunity to meet this young man, and he came out, and he was not as big as I am, he looked like he didn't shave yet, little young, in for car theft, first offender. He was obviously, mentally, completely out of it. I mean he couldn't, he was having hallucinations because every time I talked to him he was doing this, looking around, he was hearing voices. I talked to him for about an hour, trying to get him to say anything. The only thing that he said, I said, "If I could get you out of here, where would you want to go?" And he finally said, "Home." So I wrote on a yellow pad a temporary restraining order application, I served it on the warden, and then I appealed to him as a human being. I said, "Look, you know, we can go and try to torture the judge into having a hearing, and, and do all this and get the lawyers involved." I said, "But surely you don't want a young man just to be viciously gang raped over and over again in your institution, under your own humanity. Won't you please move him?" And so they moved him, but listen to what happened. They moved him from the open ward, where he had been victimized, to the hospital floor, and they locked him in a cell so that nobody could get to him. Now this is inhumane for somebody who's mentally deranged and, and needs help, but he's at least protected from people being able to get to him, so I thought. I learned about a week later when I came back to the prison, that at night the inmate orderlies had the keys to the cells, and that they had victimized this young man while he was up there in the hospital floor for his own protection. Now to me--we later got him sent to a mental hospital. And I hope that they were able to do something to restore him to sanity. But to me, that is a classic example of the kind of vicious inhumanity and disregard for people. And any system that would treat young people that way, or have a classification system like that, is an abomination. Story_ID: 611913 Speaker 1: So when we hear things about prisons and conditions in them, it may be to say, well, there are a lot of bad guys, there are a lot of bad guys, I've met a lot of them. But there's so much more than that that is at issue and at stake, and it's--not only the treatment of individuals, it's the kind of society we insist up on having and we've got to fight back and push back because look at, look at what this is doing to black people, the increasing numbers of women, the disproportionate impact on our young men. It's, it's a vicious, vicious system. So that's one example of the kind of suffering that I saw. Here's another minor example, because I had just, I've, unfortunately a mind full of these stories, which is a terrible thing to carry around in your head to remember them. But I went and talked to, because there was an outbreak of tuberculosis and so we had filed to try to force the prison [Georgia State Prison, Reidsville, Georgia] to test everybody to see did these inmates have tuberculosis. There was one very handsome, tall, young brother whose name was Eugene X [ph.], he was a Muslim, and he was found with tuberculosis. And he had been coughing and hacking, he looked so pitiful and frail when I first met him, and they did get him some treatment. A couple of weeks later, I was talking to another inmate and I said, "Well, you know, at least they got Mr. Barber [ph.] some care for his tuberculosis, and everybody has been tested, and so I feel better about that." And he looked me in the eye, he said, "What?" He said, "I was his cellmate for a year, they never tested me." So you see the indifference with which human beings lives and wellbeing. I don't think that we put these people in prison so they can develop tuberculosis or be gang raped. It's, it's, they may have done things that were wrong but there's vicious cruelty. Story_ID: 611914 Speaker 1: Now my life, I think, was saved by a death row prisoner. This is an interesting tidbit. This is a white man. His name was Troy [Leon] Gregg. He was one of the lead plaintiffs in a case called Gregg versus Georgia [Gregg v. Georgia, 1976], in which the death penalty was upheld with standards, and this must have been in 1976. Troy Gregg was on death row at the Georgia State Prison [Reidsville, Georgia]. He was in there, I think because of felony murder situation. Meaning that he, that he and somebody else had robbed, the other person killed whoever it was, but Gregg was held equally liable for the death as the one who pulled the trigger, and so he also got the death sentence. He was a poor, low income guy, lived in a trailer, and sort of fit the stereotype of the, the poor southern white. But he was willing to testify about the harassment and treatment of black inmates on death row, and also about the conditions of confinement under which he suffered. I'll skip to the chase. On the day before a hearing that we were going to have on conditions of confinement and death row, I had insisted to the judge that the death row prisoners be transferred from the prison to the courthouse in, in order to have the hearing, that it was inherently coercive to have this hearing at the prison, and that they, like everyone else, should be brought to the court. And the court had ruled with me, although the defendants sorely objected. So we had the hearing. And but, before the hearing, Troy Gregg told me he said, "Listen, Lynn [HistoryMaker Lynn Jones Huntley]," he said, "I know that they're planning to take the death row prisoners to the courthouse--to Tattnall County [Georgia] courthouse." I said, "Yes." He said, "Well, I'm going to tell you something that could get me killed if it got out," he said, "But you seem like a nice person, and I know you're just trying to help us." And I said, "Really, what is it?" He said, "Don't take the death sentence prisoners to Tattnall County." He said, "Something is going to jump off, and you could be really hurt." And so I took his advice, I went back to the court, said I changed my mind in view of their delays and blah, blah, I would have the hearing for the death sentence prisoners at the Georgia State Prison. Fast forward it's now four years later, I'm working in the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] in Washington [D.C.] again in a trial section involving prison and jail litigation. I'm reading Corrections [Today] magazine one night, and there is an article: Troy Gregg and two other inmates had escaped from prison, from death row, and he was found murdered and drowned in a pond not too far from the prison. Now I don't know whether he was part of a conspiracy to escape at that time or not, but something tells me that when he told me that that's exactly what he was doing. That he knew, although he was under sentence of death, or life in prison, will never get out, that he saw something in me as a person and his humanity was touched, and he told me the word that perhaps had kept me from being in harm's way. So that shows you the complexity of doing this work. These are human beings and they have faces and voices and handwritings and names and not all of them are the, the vicious animals that we are portraying them to be. Many are people who have simply gone the wrong way, and it's a vicious system. <Files\\HM\\HM_Hutcherson_Bernice> - § 2 references coded  [1.90% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.90% Coverage Speaker 1: What about your mother's side of the family?

And my grandmother left Kentucky and went somewhere and got near the Mississippi River, and she and two mules somehow made it across the Mississippi River because she was trying to get away from the master who was molesting, of course, all the young girls her age.

And the victim was making a lot of money setting up cubicles for all the dot com businesses and so forth, great deal of money. And he and his girlfriend got a little trendy little place, re-gentrified area and they were giving a lot of parties and probably had some drugs there and so forth. And so I guess he went back to his old childhood friend to get the drugs. And I guess the childhood friend saw a lot of cash being thrown around. And here the defendant and another assailant break into the house and rape and sodomize the girlfriend in front of the victim, she's a victim as well. Throws her into the closet naked and then she opens the closet door and saw the defendant put the gun to the guy--to his childhood friend's head and shoot him, and blow off his head.

I did have to walk three miles to school [Woodville Elementary School, Richmond, Virginia] and, and to church [Mount Tabor Baptist Church, Richmond, Virginia] and I did it when I was six and seven and eight years old; which was unfortunate, because at eight years old I was molested once when I was coming from school, walking alone.

Speaker 2: Okay, and that was still while you were in school and you were still school age? Speaker 1: That was when I was eight years old. Speaker 2: Eight, okay. Speaker 1: Yeah.

So they didn't--when you don't look at data to understand what's going on--they didn't understand that, that elderly people were victims of very specific crimes. So, we did a pilot starting--just looking at the data. Let's collect the information by age and look and see. And we found out for an example that they were very, very, very vulnerable to what was called push in crimes, where they would go to their front doors and fumble a little bit with their keys trying to get in 'cause they were older and somebody would come behind them, push them in, and rob them in the safety of and, and in the violation of their own homes, and then they would go. So, they were--so, we--but just by using data, we were able to figure out that there are certain crimes that the elderly are more prone to be victims of. And then we took that information--it just--where the applied part was also always important for me, we then took that information and started doing training with police departments. And it was at the same time when they were getting training around rape to try to sensitize them to the whole issue of rape, so we would generally go into these meetings where one person would be training on rape and I would be training around the elderly, and the bizarre kind of statements, "Well, she brought it on herself, she had on this short dress." All in the, the mindset back then was so interesting, you know, where, where they really didn't get it, you know. And it was right at that time when, you know, women's rights and, you know, respect for women, and, and the elderly were in the mix 'cause they didn't even think enough to wanna collect the statistics by--and they never asked the age of the victim, you know. References 3-4 - 1.28% Coveragewas just, you know, a minor thing. In the, in the Catholic Church, I think that they were very concerned that I was a, a liberal, you know, bra burning woman or something. They just didn't know. And I had done that study on the needs of women and girls and had talked about issues that I was called on the carpet for talking about by the head of the United Way [United Way of America; United Way Worldwide], you know, at the time. So, I was this person coming from Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island], didn't--not understanding. And I wrote about--when I wrote about the needs, I talked about teen pregnancy, domestic violence, and rape. And I can remember the, the, the person who was killed in the car accident calling me into his office and he had my paper and he said, "You've gotta take these words out of this paper." And I'm like, "What words?" And he said, "Those words." And he had circled, you know, like sexually active and--'cause it was at a time when that's what--that--you know, even then, and by then it was '81 [1981], you didn't talk about it. You know, domestic violence was something that everybody knew was going on but nobody talked about, you know. And so it's interesting because United Way then got in a lot of trouble as a result, you know. Because that same person put down this group that started up called wom- called Women's Way [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and put them down in a negative way and it just blew up in the community because of that conservative streak, you know, well intentioned but, you know, it's like women don't know, you know, what they're doing, so--and we don't talk about it. So, the, the, the Catholic church knew that part of the story, you know. Actually, the person who was killed had said that--Women's Way wanted to become part of the United Way and they got rejected, and this person told them that it was rejected because the Catholic church wouldn't stand for it 'cause they deal with things like abortion and rape crisis things and all of that. So, of course, me coming in having done the study saying we need to be doing more about it, you know, created a concern, you know, on the part--but, you know, I was told--when I got the job, I was told where the pressure points were and I worked on them and developed a excellent relationship with the, the Catholic community and the Jewish community and labor community. But, I knew I had to work on it. So, they gave me a gift of saying that we don't know if we want you in this job, you know, 'cause then you could work on it--work on it a different way.Reference 5 - 0.87% CoverageSpeaker 1: Yeah, there's an attack on juvenile--the juvenile justice system is the other one where people think that the kid--not only are the parents of the kids the enemy, but the kids are no darn good, you know, as far as people are concerned. And that's really--the kids in the juvenile justice system, I'm gonna tell you a story about the juvenile justice system and the link to the child welfare system. So, a young woman--and this is a young story that's not about a particular girl but it could be about lots of girls in the child welfare system and in the juvenile justice system. So, most of the children who are physically or sexually abused are abused by some man that they know, you know, the mother's boyfriend, the uncle, the cousin, whatever. So, a, a girl is abused, sexually abused and is taken away, put into the child welfare system, put into a foster home, runs away from the foster home, wants to be home still, wants--you know, runs away from the foster home, runs away again, is put in another one, runs away again, ultimately ends up on the street. What do you think she does to keep herself alive? Speaker 2: Prostitution, yeah. Speaker 1: What she was taught, right? Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 1: So, when she's picked up for prostitution, no one ever looks back and says, how did this child really get here? What's the trauma in her life, you know? And, and she becomes one of those kids that everybody wants to look down on. Whose fault is it, you know? And so that's, to me, the number of kids that are in that situation in this country that we don't know about, we don't talk about, we don't care about is I think just outrageous. So, yeah, we gotta--we've gotta do something about it even though there's not enough money.<Files\\HM\\HM_Jefferson_Margo> - § 2 references coded  [0.77% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.77% CoverageSpeaker 2: The white forbearer was also--god, what's his name?

In that generation, meaning my mother was born in 1916, that generation and earlier, they could be wary about discussing, you know, white ancestors because, you know, the stain of illegitimacy, or rape, or et cetera was all there. So, I did not hear that probably until I was in college [Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts]. Speaker 1: But you knew that there were people who were fair skinned in your family? Speaker 2: We knew we had--yes, absolutely, we knew we had white ancestors. But it was also rather a point, you know, black people have different opinions about this. Actually, some were quite proud, especially if they can claim, you know, descent from some aristocratic white ancestor. I didn't know that any black person ever boast about being descended from, you know, the local overseer okay (laughter), but, but (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Although that was probably even more (unclear).<Files\\HM\\HM_John_Bonnie> - § 14 references coded  [15.31% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.90% CoverageSpeaker 2: So much of all of my family is a mystery to me. And so we can talk about it, but a lot of it's gossip, and gossip and rumors, and innuendo. Again, like so many black families. But she--her mother was Mary Lee, and her father was Arthur Page. And her father left before she was born. Her father--I, you know, this is one of those things again, mystery, shrouded. I think he got her mother pregnant when she was fourteen with her sister Rosalie, and then I think they had a shotgun marriage. Which again, in this day and age, would be statutory rape, you know. And now it, and then, but it was a shotgun marriage. And then, so, right after that, the next child came, Ruby, and he was from a family of sixteen kids. And so, again, one of the legends I've heard is that he saw the writing on the wall. We're gonna have a kid every year, I'm not sticking around for this. This is not what I want to do. And so he left before she was born. And her mother struggled, lived with my mother's grandmother, my great-grandmother, in Gainesville, Florida, and it was very hard. I remember vaguely later in life when we were living in San Diego. Maybe I was four or five, or six. He came to visit and tried to establish some connection with her, and she really didn't want to. She was angry, and I think, even then, she felt he was, wanted to use her and wasn't interested. So there was no connection with her fatherReference 3 - 1.21% CoverageSpeaker 1: And the story is that when my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Lee] got a job ironing shirts for forty dollars a week, she became independent. She didn't have to live in somebody else's house. This was a big step up for her, and she sent for her daughters to come and live with her in New York [New York]. Speaker 2: That's how they came. Speaker 1: And that's how they came to New York. So in elementary school, I think, at some point. But that was very difficult. Her husband--her boyfriends, I don't know if she remarried, were physically and sexually abusive of the girls. It was not a-- Speaker 2: Your grandmother's, your grandmother's? Speaker 1: My mother [Ruby Page Schwimmer] was sexually abused by her mother's boyfriend. And they--one of the things I have again about the insights I have on this is later in life, when my mother was in her sixties, she did a lot of writing. And my mother was an English teacher. So she joined writers groups and she wrote a little vignettes, and they were stories. And they were very difficult to read. There's a story about him pounding her head on the sidewalk and bleeding, and her running away and being in a bathtub with just blood all over her. And somebody throwing things and bottles at her head, you know. It's very difficult reading. And I'm sure, much more difficult to live. She had a very difficult childhood. So even when her mother was able to send for her, and reunite the family, you know, it wasn't an easy comfortable thing. At--I think at about thirteen, she ended up moving out and becoming a mother's helper for a Jewish family. And that had a huge influence on my mother. She later converted to Judaism when I was fifteen. So the influence shehad from spending time as a teenager in the Jewish family, gave her a lot of the emphasis she had, on learning and education, and she loved what she absorbed from the Jewish culture.Reference 4 - 0.40% CoverageSpeaker 2: My sister is a doctor in Lansing, Michigan. And my brother is--owns a photography business in Charlotte [North Carolina], and they're both doing very well. My sister is actually now working at a methadone clinic, so she's helping addicts get better. Which is wonderful 'cause my sister has struggled a lot over time with, I don't know, anxiety issues and a variety of things. She's struggled a lot, I mean we were both sexually abused as children, and so she struggled a lot with that. And so I think it's a wonderful place for her to be to help other people who are struggling. Again, it's this resilience theme, right? References 5-6 - 8.81% Coverage Speaker 2: So she moved to San Diego [California] with my stepfather, who was Paul Cremaschi, and he was my evil stepfather. You know, he was a--he sexually abused my sister [April St. John Keenoy] and I. I, again, these are things you don't realize 'til you're older. So she was in Detroit [Michigan], a single mom with three kids, struggling to make ends meet. When she--I think she was still in school when my father [Lee St. John] first left and she had three babies and she was trying to finish her degree so she could be a teacher. She--the story she told me was that she was told by welfare that if she wanted welfare, she had to quit school. And I--those were the rules back then, I don't know. And she didn't want to, and the only reason, the only way she was able to stay in school was she got a loan from the Jewish Free Loan Society [JFLA]. So again she had, you know, because she had had the connections with the Jewish family, she was able to make this connection and get that help and stay in school, and finish and then get her teaching degree, and she started teaching in Detroit. So Paul Cremaschi came along and married her, and took her to San Diego. And when you think about that, she was, she was twenty-seven, he was sixty-seven when they got married. He was, he was preying on a vulnerable, poor black woman, far away from her family, with two young daughters. He married her and took her further away from anyone she had ever known, and was able to prey. He was able to prey on my sister and I for years without being caught, or stopped, or questioned, or anything. I believe now that this was, you know, something he did to probably hundreds of kids over the--his career, and he targeted us because we were vulnerable. And again, I think that's gotta to be the story of so many young black girls. He was white, but he targeted a vulnerable, poor, single black mother with two daughters. Speaker 1: And did your mother ever know that this was happening? Speaker 2: The hundred thousand dollar question everyone asks. I used to say no. Because you don't want to believe that. I think, probably the best way to say it is she had been so abused, she was fighting so many demons, she was sexually abused in her own childhood, and she never got healing from that. She struggled with so many demons about race, about that. She had seen lynchings when she was younger. She had a lot of difficult stuff going on in her head, and she tended to dissociate. So I remember telling her when I was eighteen that I was abused. And she basically said, "Well, so was I. Get over it, move on." There was not a lot of warmth or sympathy about that. It was, "Move on. I don't really wanna hear it." And, and I think some of that is her guilt, right? She had guilt around it so she just, is like, and her own pain, right? It brings up all her own pain. So she dissociates separate. Years later when I wrote my first book, 'Succeeding Sane' ['Succeeding Sane: Making Room For Joy In A Crazy World,' Bonnie St. John], that was the first time I mentioned in a book that I had been abused. And we were gonna go on 'The Montel Williams Show,' and they called her up and said, "We want you on the show." And you know, they were doing the pre-interview, and they asked her, "When's the first time you heard that she was abused?" And she said, "Well, this show." So she would continually forget. My sister tells a story that she was at an event, it was a community event with lots of people, and my sister said something about being abused. And my mother turned to her and said, "You have abuse in your family?" I mean, there was a dissociation that continuously went on. But the most painful thing for me, when I started doing my own healing work around this, and I started being willing to focus on it honestly, and process some of what had happened. There's a story that my sister tells. I say it's a story, you know, it's, it's true She told my mother when she was nine or ten, that something--she got in trouble for doing something. And she said, "This is because, this is what's going on." She was doing something sexually inappropriate, and she said, "This is why." And what she says is that mom said to her, "Well, has it stopped? Is it not going on anymore? Okay, well then, forget about it." Basically, the same thing she said to me when I was eighteen, she said to April when she was nine. And I had heard that story, and I thought it was horrible. But I didn't really process it, and it wasn't until I was in my thirties, wasn't until I was in my thirties that I did the math. If my sister was nine or ten, I was still being abused and nobody asked. Nobody checked. 'Cause I was abused from the age of two to the age of seven. And so this question of, did my mother know, is complex. She had, she had issues. Story_ID: 521602 Speaker 1: How did it stop? Speaker 2: I went to therapy when my daughter [Darcy Deane] was young, and I had to. I had, what I had done, okay. I had literally forgotten about it. I had forgotten, erased the memories from the time that it happened until I was eighteen. And what happened when I was eighteen is my stepfather [Paul Cremaschi] died. And I've come to understand, if you read about it, that this is a common thing. That when the perpetrator dies, you feel safe enough to bring the memories back. And so, it's the weirdest thing, because it's not like one day you wake up and go, "Ah. I was abused. Ah!" You know, it's like the best way I can explain of what it occurs, how it occurs in your brain is it's like a path. Imagine that you live in a neighborhood and you walk around the neighborhood, and there's this road, dirt road that kind of goes off. And you just haven't walked down that path in a long time. You know it's there, you know you were down there years ago, you know it's there, you just never think about it. And so you walk past every day and you never go. And then all of a sudden, when you're eighteen and you walk down that path, and you go, "Oh, yeah. I always knew this was here, but I just never went." And so it doesn't shock you. It doesn't surprise you. You just realize, "I remember this, and I haven't remembered it for ten years." Anyway, it just, I know if people haven't experience that, it's just impossible to imagine. But at eighteen, I remembered that I was sexually abused. And I only remembered little snippets of it, but I talked to my mom [Ruby Page Schwimmer] about it. But it wasn't until I had my own daughter that it started to become a real problem for me. So I just shut it down, I just, my mom said, "Don't think about it." I said, "Okay." But once I had my own daughter, the pain started to bubble up in many ways, and I didn't realize that that was what was happening at first. But things like, when she would come home after school, I would black out. Because that's when I would be abused, is every day when I came home from school, and he was there and my mother was at work. And so there were, there were things--and I say blackout. Like, we'd be playing and I would just fall asleep. And I didn't, this would repeatedly happen in the middle of the afternoon. And it's, you know, it's crazy stuff is happening, and the anxiety was coming up, and it took me a while to put together what it was. And that if I wanted to be a mother, I needed to treat it. And I think that's one of the things when I look back, my mother never did the healing work. And that's part of the reason why she missed all the signs and she couldn't, you know, and I realized, if I don't do my healing work, my daughter could be abused and I might fall asleep and miss it. (Laughter) You know? So I was motivated to do the work. And some people, you know, I am a strong person of faith. And I think for me, at that time, I was working on my prayer life a lot, and that gave me the strength to do the work. But I don't believe, some people believe if you just forgive the past, and pray, you're done. I had to do more than that. Maybe that works for some people, but I had to go to therapy, I went to a hypnotist that took me back, so that's why I know that it ended when I was seven. I'm sorry, you asked me, "How did it end?" And I know this because I went into therapy and because I did the hypnosis. Gosh, this is hard. So he had been abusing me for years. He had been playing little sex games with me after school, when I would come home from school. And, and, especially when I was in kindergarten, you know, I'd get home earlier than my brothers and sisters. You know, he was able to have time alone with me. And I think one of the unwritten rules was that no one spoke. That you didn't speak when these things, the unspeakable, right? Because nobody spoke. When I was seven, I said something and he immediately stopped his activities and left, and it never happened again. Okay, this is the really hard part. So in the hypnosis, I had to go back and relive some of these things. And it was very judicious about the healing. About--because what you're trying to do is go back and unpack what happened, and what you learned to believe because of the things that happened. And you want to be able to undo that process of creating false beliefs about yourself and about the world. And, which would be things like you don't matter, and you don't have any value, and your value is only as to pleasure somebody else, you know? You have to undo all these beliefs. I felt like it was a process of, like the Greek myth, when Hercules goes back into Hades and goes in to save someone and pull them out. That I had to do these therapy sessions, to go back and find this child and bring them out of Hell. It was a very difficult period. Story_ID: 521603 Speaker 1: But reliving that memory of the last time he sexually abused me (crying), the most horrible part about it is that the child became very depressed. Because as a child, I was sad that the abuse stopped. Because it was a feeling of affection and warmth and love and it was, I don't know, it was normal. It was what was there. And so I thought I had done something wrong. That was the third grade, and I got all Cs in third grade. I was always a straight A student through my whole life, and I remember I got all Cs in third grade. And I think, I never put it together, until much later, until I did this hypnosis and I understood. I became a very depressed child because I had done something wrong and I was being punished by my stepfather [Paul Cremaschi]. And, any sane adult human who looks at that and says, "How can you twist a young child into somebody who would become depressed when it stops?" It's horrible (crying). Speaker 2: Did you find yourself angry with your mother [Ruby Page Schwimmer]? Speaker 1: Not until after she died. My mother was an amazing person. It's so funny, given what I've shared with you. It's gonna be hard to reconcile with that, with the fact that she was an educator. She was looking after everyone's children. She was the principal of many schools, and she made a very positive difference in not only the lives of the students who were there, but the teachers and the parents. She died at age sixty-seven, and at her funeral, over three hundred people came and spent hours telling my brother [Wayne St. John] and my sister [April St. John Keenoy] and I what she had done for them. And how much she had done for them. That she had kept kids in school who, you know, gotten them off drugs and somebody said, "She helped me find a husband." You know, or parents, "She helped me get back in school." Or teachers, "She helped my further degree." And, you know, she did so much for so many people. But when you look back, she was a very, you know, her life, her childhood was so horrible, she was fighting with demons. When I was growing up, she used to take us to motivational speakers, she used to spend hours writing affirmations. Writing positive statements over and over again. So what I learned from her was that her life was messy and painful, but she fought to try to stay more positive. She didn't always win, but she fought for more positivity for herself, for her children, you know, even though, okay, she made this one really big mistake with marrying Paul Cremaschi, and not being able to see the signs. But she filled our house with books. She made us love education. She supported our interests, whether it was skiing or my brother's photography. He built a--he's a photographer now. He built, she bought him his first enlarger to develop pictures, at a pawn shop. You know, and helped him build a dark room in the garage, and she gave us so much. It's--at her funeral, my brother's speech, he said, "She was the best of moms, and she was the worst of moms. But she was never in between." So I valued my relationship with her. When she turned sixty, I took her to England for a week, we spent a week in England together. Shortly before she died, I got to speak on a Disney cruise [Disney Cruise Line] and I took her with her. She loved, me with her, she loved Disney [The Walt Disney Company], and Roy Disney [Roy E. Disney] was on the ship. And Jennifer Hudson was singing on the ship, and it was an amazing trip. I loved my mother and I wanted that relationship. But after she died, I think I was willing, I was willing to admit more things to myself. And it's like what I said about when my stepfather died. You're willing to go down roads that you didn't go down for many years. When my mother died, it felt like, you know if you took a beach ball, and you pushed it under the water, and then you took your hand away, it would shoot up? That's what it felt like to me, is that there was all this stuff that had been pushed down for so long, and it shot up after she died, and I couldn't stop it. So I was, I had a lot of anger after she died that I had to process. But I didn't share that with her. Story_ID: 521604References 7-8 - 1.01% CoverageSo I leaned, and then I said, "I don't want nothing. I can do this on my own. I'm gonna look cool. I'm gonna be cool. I'm gonna be like everybody else," you know. And when I had my daughter [Darcy Deane], and then the pain of the sexual abuse started coming up, I couldn't do it on my own anymore, and the pain was so intense. I was going through that process of going back over the memories, and doing the healing, and I was still a mom. And I would have to come back and be a mom, dry my tears, and come back and be a mom, or go and give a motivational speech for everybody. And because I had to hold it together for my daughter, sometimes when I would fly to another city to give a speech, that was when I could break down and cry, and just let the pain out. And I remember I was in a hotel room, and I was supposed to give a speech, and I was laying on the bed and just sobbing. And just--the pain was just coming over me so much, I couldn't get off the bed. I couldn't get up. And I remember, I just said, "Help me, God." And it was like it lifted and I could get off the bed. And that was a moment for me that I thought, this is real. This isn't talking to your invisible friend, God is real, and I want to know more about that. And so, having to go through that difficult healing process really brought me back to God and really helped me, inspired me to explore my relationship with prayer. And so it was because of that that I ended up writing the book, 'How Strong Women Pray' [Bonnie St. John]. Because I developed my prayer life, I'd started to get more of a relationship with God.References 9-10 - 1.36% Coverage Speaker 2: So I left the White House [Washington, D.C.], and went home, and I got pregnant and had Darcy [Darcy Deane] and started a business. So I thought this was a good idea. To quit my job, get pregnant, and start a business, all at the same time. It was very difficult. It was kind of like that first week of skiing. It was very, very challenging. I was exhausted, I only had like twenty hours of babysitting, and was, you know, so starting a business was really slow. I quickly realized, most entrepreneurs were working sixty hours a week, you know. And I was working, maybe fifteen, you know, hours a week. And so things that would take an entrepreneur a week, it would take me a month. And so it was slow going, and it was exhausting, and I was a new mother, which we know is hard. Plus, I was starting to have a lot of the anxiety issues about the sexual abuse, and so it was hard getting started, but I wouldn't trade it for anything, because I was able, I had always--when I was in fourth grade, I was writing my first book ['Succeeding Sane: Making Room For Joy In A Crazy World,' Bonnie St. John]. I had always wanted to write books. And reading books had been my solace. I read books on the playground when other girls were playing double Dutch jump rope and hopscotch, and I couldn't do what they were doing, I would sit and read a book. And I would travel on adventure. I would be a superhero in the book 'cause I couldn't do it on the playground. And I would read a Nancy Drew book in one night. I would go in the bathroom and turn the light on and stay up and read a book, you know, at night. They were my escape venue. My, where I could dream, where I could be someone bigger or better. I could explore a mental world. And so I always wanted to write because books had given me so much. I wanted to do that. So getting to start my own business, get my first book contract with Simon and Schuster [Simon and Schuster, Inc.], write a book and then be at home, you know, in the afternoons and I could teach my daughter to swim in the pool and take her for walks in the park, and I was able to create a life for myself that I wanted.References 11-12 - 0.86% CoverageSpeaker 2: So when Darcy [Darcy Deane] was five, I--we got divorced.

And Darcy's father [Grant Deane] is a wonderful person, but in the end, we decided that it--we needed to get a divorce, and it was a very painful decision as it always is. But we worked through it we, we did a lot of therapy. We did a lot of trying to do it in a good way and still to be able to jointly parent Darcy, which we do. We do, in fact, with the home schooling, he did half of the homeschooling. So she would go back and forth. We eventually ended up in an arrangement where I moved to the East Coast. And she would be with me for a month, and then she would be with him for a month. And so we would hand off, you know, here's what she learned this month, and now it's your turn to teach her for a month, and that was the way she could go back and forth that way.

And so the next book that we have coming out is called 'Micro-Resilience' ['Micro-Resilience: Minor Shifts for Major Boosts in Focus, Drive, and Energy,' Bonnie St. John and Allen P. Haines]. And Allen [Allen P. Haines] is co-authoring it with me. He's actually gonna get his name on the cover this time. Not just to do all the work, but actually get his name on the cover. And it's taking many of the things I learned, coping with healing from sexual abuse, staying motivated, being an athlete. There's a lot of science, there's a lot of things that I read along the way about that. We went back and scoured the literature, the current literature, and found even more things. And micro-resilience is a set of tools. There is five frameworks and twenty-one tools that give you minor shifts you can make in your life each day that give you big boosts in energy and focus, and drive. So it's, this is the culmination of my work in many ways. Is to take the things I've learned, turn it into easy tools, and give it to people so that everybody can have more resilience.<Files\\HM\\HM_Johnson_Bev> - § 2 references coded  [0.88% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.88% CoverageSpeaker 2: I remember a story, a young woman who talked about her uncles who had abused her as a child and she was afraid to talk about it.

She did know why, but didn't know why, or didn't want to address why because she was trying to hide the, the sexual abuse from the uncles until as we were talking. And she heard well it's okay to talk about it or get help and have counseling when she's hearing Dr. Jeffries [Dorothy Jeffries-Anderson] on, or Dr. [Warren] Harper, or I had other doctors and, and counselors talk about it and she talked about it. I remember her crying and then finally she was able to get some help. But those kinds of stories that, that touch you that you hear.

Maybe to themselves, they won't have an outward response but they're going to respond to it. And--but my father knowing, that the livelihood of his children and his wife [Estelle Campbell Jones] depended upon his decorum, had too much sense to have casual flirtations. He had too much sense for that. So a couple of times he got accused and the union was able to deal with it you know, and it didn't affect him. He was able to move on. But that has always you know made, it made me aware when I first came to legal [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] first as a lawyer, the plight of African American men and what men can endure when a woman makes a false claim. When a woman makes--it's an awful thing to do to a man. And so I come at it from that, you know. And I you know I think about all the death penalty cases I handled with men on death row for allegedly raping white women, throughout the South. When I became a lawyer that's what it was. And that's where I spent the first four years as a lawyer, fighting that, you know. So my father's experience I think shaped me in that 'cause he would come home and the union had to go to bat and blah, blah, blah, blah. So he had the--and then he had a couple of experiences--but they had a pleasant experience. He would come home and somebody gave him a big tip. That was a big deal.

And they was--again and I'm trying death penalty cases in Alabama. I'm getting folks off death row. Most black men in the South on death--were on death row for rape, allegedly raping white women. And they were convicted, you know, before you--and not only that, rape was a capital offense. A capital offense was any offense the state determined, any felony the state determined to be a capital offense. Nighttime burglary was a capital offense. Anything the state wanted to make a capital offense, was. And so that's the vibe we were functioning in. I mean, and prison teeming with black men, you know, for robbery and you know these--and rape was what they loved to throw at a black man. And I jumped into the middle of this. I had jumped into the middle of this and I mean it took some of everything, but I mean trying cases in southern courts.

So, I wasn't very comfortable, in that environment, so I requested to go do all of my time, full-time, with the children, and it was during that time, I was counseling with children who had been sent to the state hospital, and we would go to court with them, as a social work intern. References 3-4 - 1.23% CoverageSpeaker 2: Well, I don't know about remarkable.

So we were, we, we went there in his defense and we were met by people with their guns and waving--they knew we were coming for the demonstration. And we called the state troopers, state--they did called the state patrol to let them know that but they ignored it. And we went to the church and made sure everybody was disarmed. That's the way they always did in marches and decided that we could not let the [Ku Klux] Klan keep us from marching. So we set out to march. Normally I marched with my husband. But this time he said, he felt the danger involved and he said, "You'd better drive the car," 'cause he knew I was going to go. And I drove the car by myself. No one was in with me. So as we rounded the corner going down the street downtown Decatur we saw this mob. And we were within the block where they were and they started shooting. And they immediately rushed to my husband and the front line and took them away. A couple of kids were struck but not seriously. And then they ran back to my car.

I wouldn't dream of approaching that but what I will say is that factually my father [Elrick Williams] told me that this is how his father [John Henry "Jack" Williams] made money, initially and then my grandfather would lend money at certain rates. By now my grandfather had moved from St. Ann's Bay which is where he was born to Kingston which became the capitol of Jamaica. My grandfather at the age of around thirty was married to a woman her name was Mae [Williams]. They were not able to have children and my grandfather was at that point reasonably prosperous for a black Jamaican and Mae it turns out that it was Mae who could not have children because when my grandmother, Sarah [Lloyd] who was thirteen was sent from the country to work in their household, Sarah became pregnant by Jack. I am sure the scandal was significant although I will say in that era thirteen year olds were getting married, having babies all the above. But still scandalous, this is--I don't, I'm sure they were not first cousins, they probably were like third or fourth cousins but it's still unseemly and in today's world it certainly would have been statutory rape. So my father was born to Jack Williams and Sarah Lloyd who when he was born she was fourteen years old. I found my father's birth certificate, in fact, there are two birth certificates. The first birth certificate that reflects his original date of birth indicates that Mae was present at his birth. I went to the address where that's listed on my father's birth certificate at 9 Hannah Street in Hannah Town, Kingston [Jamaica] and we believe that's where the midwife was. My grandmother, of course, was sent out of that house when she was pregnant and she probably lived with relatives in Kingston until the baby--my father was born.

So he was kind of pushing that along. And I had thought about it because I loved biology and I thought about delivering babies. I thought that that would be the most noble thing to do, to bring children into the world. And there was one weekend that he actually set me up at D.C. [District of Columbia] General with one of his buddies, who's a doctor, who's an obstetrician. And we put our scrubs on and we did deliver babies together for a weekend. And it was actually kind of the most horrific experiences of childbirth, because you had a lot of people there, no prenatal care--very, very poor--emergency deliveries. Nothing was pretty. We had one woman who was obese and was a heroin addict and her baby was dead inside of her and had been inside of her for a while. But because she was a heroin addict, she hadn't naturally delivered. So, I was with this doctor, Dr. Lawer was his name. And we came in together with our scrubs, and I was just his little assistant. And she was there, and she was very angry, very upset. I think she might have still been high, and she was cursing at him because she was one of the only white people in the hospital because D.C. General mostly is predominantly black. So she was cursing at him, accusing him of, you know, undermining what was going on, you know, her baby and all that stuff. So it was really strange and disturbing to see. There was another young, young woman, a teenager. It was like her second or third child. Nobody was there with her. Nothing was happening on time, so she didn't have time for any medications. So she's screaming and crying and everything is just very traumatic. Another woman who came in had been raped. And so it was all these different types of deliveries and experiences within that weekend. And it did not discourage me at all. I loved it even more. I mean, I was not deterred by seeing all of that. It was pretty gross and disturbing, but I still was on that path. At the same time I also loved storytelling, drawing. I loved the visual as opposed to the print. I thought print was way too confining, although I loved to write stories, I loved to tell stories. I loved to, my sister [Suzette Malveaux] and I ever since we were kids we always had these little play school, little characters almost like little dolls, and we were always acting out things, acting out different dramatic storytelling or family drama or whatever. So, that was also something that I was also interested in. So when I went to college, I had these two competing interests.

My mother, my grandmother had three other children before my mother. My mother looks white, apparently her father was, and my grandmother gave her away to a white woman in the town, and I'm not sure if it was Mississippi or Memphis [Tennessee]. So my mother was raised white until she was seven.

Then her grandmother dies and her mother at this point, who I think was probably a woman of the night (laughter); it just does not sound other than that.

They were charged with a conspiracy of silence because supposedly a white woman had been raped in the town of Brownsville [Texas] and they were accused of it. They accused--well they said that one of them did it. But because there was this conspiracy of silence, they dishonorably discharged one hundred and six of them. And it wasn't until in the '70's [1970's] when it came to light and I do know that [Vice President] Hubert Humphrey entered a bill in Congress [1973] and--or maybe it was our state legislature, I don't know which, but anyway he was awarded twenty-five thousand dollars.

I think he might have autographed that book. But he and Dorsey Willis became very good friends. And he was visiting him in Los Angeles [California]. And, and became very, very concerned about him.

Now, I never discussed that with my grandfather; I heard it said about him by many family members on the Richardson family, and there's a lot of history written about the Richardsons by the way--the county has done--there's a, there's a history project in Virginia where the Richardsons are--that their family history has been traced; there were a lot of them (laughter).<Files\\HM\\HM_Miles_Steen> - § 2 references coded  [1.34% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.34% CoverageMy father's full name was Austin Andrew Davis, and he was from Bassfield, Mississippi, but the community was called Sweet Water [Mississippi].

My name Ollisteen, and there was a little change on the spelling, but it was Ollie on the paternal side and Christine on the maternal side; that's Ollisteen. But--and I don't know anything else about daddy's side much except I do know what my great-grandfather's name was Ab [Davis]. And I understand that granddaddy had four brothers who went to Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama, and of course, he was there in Mississippi, and another one might have been in Mississippi. But they scattered about. And like granddaddy was born ten years after slavery. And I would talk to him one time. I interviewed him about what it was like growing up in, in that time period. And he would talk about how a black man could be lynched and killed for daring to lift his eyes to a white woman. And when they were walking down the street that they would have to cross over to the other side, rather than be on the sidewalk at the same time with, with, with a white woman. And he said, but they could rape our women and they could do anything they wanted to you know, to, to black woman. And he said and thus the range of colors that we have in the family, the different complexions in the family. But granddaddy was a--an original mason. He could not read or write. He worked on the railroad building all the way up to Chicago [Illinois]. And he was quite the sage, despite the fact that he didn't have a formal education. He was a very, very educated man and a very wise man. And I gravitated toward my paternal grandfather more. I didn't see either one of them any more or less than the other, but I gravitated toward grandpa-- Speaker 1: That's Albert Davis?

I, I--that was big time, I had to put that in there, that soap opera, had nothing else to read so I put it in my paper and it was good reading. And then the minister out in Denver, Colorado who, and, and I know this minister, who had six hundred and seventy eight insurance policies on people in his church. They're supposed to be employees. Hundred thousand dollar policies on each one of them. Just so happened one of the women died, she had five kids, and you know, ten thousand was gonna go to the family, he gets ninety thousand. So that was a red flag for the insurance company. And then when they checked it out that newspaper out there, just awful.

Well, let me put it this way. I didn't know growing up as a child how--that everyone didn't live like this, okay. I knew that I had relatives that lived in other areas, but they were poor, too, and they lived in worse conditions. You know, they lived in apartment buildings where rats were running around. And I didn't want to spend the night because they had rats, or they had lice in the bed. So, certainly, where I lived was much better than where they were living. In terms of how other black people were living in the city, I had no clue as to where they were living or what their neighborhoods were like, because everyone I knew lived in a housing project. What I did know for sure is that, you know, I didn't like the violence. You know, I didn't like the fact that you had to protect yourself so much, and you had to be tough. And I didn't like the fact that there was so much sexual abuse and things like that, simply because, you know, people were vulnerable. I knew at an early age, I didn't like that. I knew at twelve and thirteen and fourteen, and certainly going into the teen years, that this is something that I would not want to bring my child--an environment that I would not want to bring my child up in. Now, on the other side of that, did my parents [Carrie Williams Duncan and Joseph Duncan] do their best to make sure that we were taken of? They certainly did. You know, we had Christmas and we had holidays, and we had, you know, the nicest things they could buy. We had full meals. We went to the parks, and we went to the lakefront, and we went to Riverview [Riverview Amusement Park, Chicago, Illinois] when it was open. And all of those things and experiences that they could give us, we had. So, we didn't know how bad off we were. I didn't know how bad off we were, and how poor we were, but I knew that we were poor.<Files\\HM\\HM_Montes_Peggy> - § 2 references coded  [1.31% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.31% CoverageSpeaker 2: Well, I--I really loved that experience because we were able to--you could see the progress that we were able to make in terms of making improvements within city government. Moving those women into high-paying jobs, better positions, changing or starting programs that would enable them to get better jobs. Like I was saying with the [Chicago, Illinois] Fire Department--the fact that once we understood why the women couldn't pass the physical, then we had a program created with the University of Illinois [at Chicago] that actually trained those women in terms of developing their upper body strength and that was really fantastic to have the number of females. It was a large number that graduated because they came out of that program. The same thing when we worked with the [Chicago] police department. We wanted to make certain that more women would become lieutenants, maybe captains and working with the police department, we were able to be successful in having those women promoted. We were also able to look at what was happening in terms of sexual assault. We came up with programs there--what the first person--what the first policemen would do when he came to interview, or came to the aid of the rape victim. So we were able to put in some very good programs, and I feel--like I said it was a very rewarding experience and I'm happy that I was able to be a part of it.<Files\\HM\\HM_Neisser_Winifred> - § 2 references coded  [0.51% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.51% Coverage Speaker 2: Well, we did a lot of movies about violence, you know, against women.

'Something About Amelia' was also a big one I--that I didn't work on, which was about incest where Ted Danson played a father that had abuse- sexually molested his daughter. And then there was one on AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]. God, I can't think of the name of that one--with Aidan Quinn about, you know, young men who died, who came home and, and had AIDS ['An Early Frost'].

And my mother would say that they would always try to ask her about it and her thing was like, "I didn't--I don't know anything about that slavery, I was in the big house playing with little missy. That was my job." Tiny little five foot woman, clearly mixed race, straight hair, looked pretty white, so. Speaker 2: ut she didn't talk about any of that? Speaker 1: No, she didn't, my mother said.

Speaker 2: Or her--what the blood lines were? Speaker 1: Or what the blood lines were--no, no. But you know, it's so funny when people talk about mixed race people now, because if you look--identify themselves as mixed race. Because if you look at any Africana person--any African American on the street, anywhere, clearly we're all mixed race; or you know, the vast majority of us are. So, you know, this notion of kind of like my mixed race is better than yours because mine was voluntary and yours was rape is absurd. But I notice this kind of pushing of this racial ambiguity in the culture in terms of way people identify themselves, but also in terms of I'm sure you notice this, the visual of ads and commercials and what you s- is being pushed.

You can't just drop them from the welfare rolls and say, "You're on your own buddy." They're gonna find a way to make the money, and, and it's usually to society's detriment. With--but if you refocus and you say you know the amount of money that we're spending on prisons, that we're spending on protection, and police protection, if we put a third of that into creating a topnotch educational system, we wouldn't have to export, excuse me, we wouldn't have to import the majority of our scientists. We wouldn't have to import so many people who do the technical things, because our, our educational system is so broken that the majority of people just wanna use a product. They don't know--they don't want to build a product. They don't want to invent a product. So, we've gone from being inventors to be consumers, because we have forgotten that education shouldn't be a privilege it should be a right, and we don't put that money into it and then the black community is impacted even more. When it comes to the churches, I don't see where most of the pastors are doing any more than some of these businesspeople are doing, which is basically raping and pillaging, making as much money as possible and leaving dodge with the money, meaning not living in the communities that they're servicing. And when you don't live in the community that you're servicing, then you don't feel the need to put back in to that community.

Yeah, I mean the--you think about the history of the Congo and, and it's one it began as a geographically isolated country or if you can call it a country. A region because of this dense, thick, dense rain forest and was exploited by King Leopold [Leopold II of Belgium] in the most atrocious kind of way, you know, the kind of atrocities that he, he committed there. But out of that, you have this legacy of repression that's continues to perpetuate itself. And even now you have a war that's going on that has claimed 3 million people since 1997 and yet receives relatively little coverage. But the real victims of this war are the women and children who were pretty much helpless and who didn't start this war, who don't fight the war but find themselves bearing the brunt of it. And one of the things that I went to look at in the Congo are the kind of gender specific human rights abuses that women suffer. And what we're seeing is that rape has become one of the primary tools of war used against both men and women but because rape is a tool, a tool of war, there are certain kind of medical problems that arise, a lot of the women end up gang raped and being "ruined," which is going to be the title of my play. And once they're ruined, they're driven out from their villages and they're forced to wander. So now you have this class of women who are homeless. And, and because you have these wandering women you lose a generation of mothers who are not raising sons, those sons get sucked back into the war so the cycle continues. And so I, I've been spending (laughter) a lot of time contemplating this and trying to figure out a way of dramatizing it but I don't wanna dramatize it in the typical way, in which you, you its documentary style in which these women become talking heads. I wanna find a way of, of telling a universal story, much in the way that Bertolt Brecht did with "Mother Courage." That's accessible, that's human, that has some humor (laughter) and that lives beyond the crisis. <Files\\HM\\HM_O_Neal-McCray_Hellen> - § 1 reference coded  [0.47% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.47% CoverageSpeaker 2: Things have probably always been heating up in--in a--in a strange kind of way.

And my husband was in, in New York, not with us then.

There's 300 Klansmen down there and four regalia and they are waiting for you all.

They went through the town and packed up every--took people out of their houses, packed up every black person on the trucks and drove them to Alabama and dropped them off. I mean they left stoves burning, food cooking, they left all their belongings, they left everything. And there hadn't been a black person living in Forsyth County in seventy-five years.

And my grandfather got shot by white people in Mississippi when they were living in Mississippi and my grandfather died with the bullet shells still imbedded between his spine and the spleen because the doctors could not remove it. And how they would run from white masters and overseers and things in the south and how they would resist being beaten and how they resisted living in the south and having to jump off the sidewalks when white people would walk toward them. And how if they worked--one of my cousins worked in a white woman's house and she accused him of raping her and they had to take him one night and put him in a casket and sip--ship him to Chicago too.

And then they got into--somebody got in--he got in touch with someone and they got in touch with this funeral director and he set up the mechanism to ship him north in a casket.

So they started shooting into the house and he ran out the back and ran through a thicket and ran along some bushes and things along the Mississippi River and got away.

You know you go to talk to a corporate person about raising money for those kinds of programs, and they don't want to admit that exists. They wanna think of happy smiley faces in children and sometimes you talk about daycare and you talking to people who say you know I go to work every day and I pay for my own day care. So, you start talking about subsidized day care. Well people go to work they need to pay for their own day care, why would I subsidize that. So, when you talk about eliminating racism people don't want to talk about racism. They say we get along fine, we don't need to have talks about that, so the fund raising challenge or running the YWCA when you're not running a gym and swim program and there's something that somebody can feel good about and say, I'm taking twenty little poor kids of projects and teaching them how to swim and their playing basketball and they all look happy, when you're talking about those issues that nobody wants to talk about--they're not sexy hot issues; it's difficult, so.

The other challenge was in terms of getting a board people who were people of substance because again the YWCA is a women's organization, and we don't have men on board. We have men, women, and so- Speaker 1: Is it, is it by, by design or no, no, no-- Speaker 2: By design. It provides women an opportunity for leadership, so that's one of our goals to empower and, and, and train women for leadership. So, we never have the top people in the corporation on the board.

That's a major thing, so that we've recognized women of achievement. It's called the Women of Achievement luncheon, Leader Luncheon. For twenty-eight years that's been going on. So, most of the women who are the movers and shakers in this city have been recognized. After I came, I said if we couldn't and we were recognizing women in education, business, and I said well how come we're not recognizing women who are doing work in racial justice because there are very few people doing this. So, why don't we give a racial justice award and give this award to a woman who is doing outstanding work to improve race relations in the city. And, if, if we come in a kind of occasion where we can't find a woman who's doing it, we won't give the award and that will say a lot to the community about what's happening in the way of race relations. And so we've given the award to Julia Stasch, you know who became the mayors', working in the mayor's office, but at the time she worked for Richie [Richard] Stein because that, Richie Stein was a large developer in Chicago who Julia was his top woman and she made sure that women and minorities were including on all the construction projects, so she really did a good job.

And we gave it to the woman who used to head up the Community Renewal Society. I can't remember her name. She was very active in Trinity Church. She's a minister. We gave it to [JM] Willie Barrow one year. And we've only given the award--we gave it to Lucretia Bailey who works for the Urban Affairs Institute. And then we gave it to two doctors. One's black woman doctor and a white woman doctor who worked on events to bring children together and its kind--it, it was children of violence. It was taking children out of violence and they're both doctors. One worked on the girl X. Remember the girl X who was-- Speaker 2: Right.

A lot of people don't know what. So, they said, you know, how could you be a pro-choice, you know, how could you be a baby killer. I got calls in the middle of the night calling me a lesbian baby killer, 4 o'clock in the morning phone calls. So, once they got themselves organized and put it out there on the internet it had an incredible ripple effect for us. I got five, we kept track of them, 5,088 emails, but really I got about fifty because a lot of them were the same form letter saying the same thing and so that the Christian right is very organized and we ever get as organized as they are and we learn how to get out to our constituents we believe in the elimination of racism and economic empowerment of women and get them to attack the way they did us, we would be light years ahead. Story_ID: 179788 Speaker 1: I often wonder why organizations don't do that or maybe is that, you know when you really look at it is it a really good use of time to organize people to write form letters and send them in to Pat Robinson or somebody to tell them to knock or off or somebody like a Rush Limbaugh or somebody, I mean (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: Well, they're effective in the since that they affect our funders. For instance, the YWCA in Nashville [Tennessee] lost $700,000 dollars as a result of this campaign because, you know, it's the South and they're a little more conservative and the tone of the letter, I mean, you know, then you get in a defensive position where you're saying this is what we're not rather than this is what we are and so you're constantly saying and, and we have such a wide tent. We have some people--like I was on a radio show for instance in Alaska where a guy asked me did I believe in abortion and it was over this issue and I said to him well let's presume, I'm a Catholic, so I don't believe in abortions for myself, but if my daughter got pregnant as a result of a rape I would have to reevaluate my position on abortion and his response to me was, "Oh come on Ms., come on you know that nobody gets pregnant the first time they get raped." So, I said to him how many times does somebody have to get raped before they get pregnant? Well, you know what I mean we're going to commercial, so he went to commercial and then he came back and said, "This is really going to be rough," and his callers started calling me and saying how did we call ourselves a Christian organization and, and I told you earlier when I was a kid I went to Bible school and one of the things we had to do in Bible school is learn the Bible verse for every letter in the alphabet. So, I think he met his match because I said to him sir all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, and he was floored. He just--(unclear)--(laughing) and didn't know what to do and then he was clambering on and on and I said to him be still the Lord is in this holy temple. So, then I started running down my ABC's about judging, not lest ye be judged, and finally he hung up and he said, "All right well we're just gonna have to agree to disagree, God bless you," (laughing) and I thought all that Bible school training came in handy. But, it's that right wing, you know, they are, they're very organized and they can affect your funding. You know, we got a lot of letters from people saying I'm never gonna give the YWCA another dime and please take my name out of your records and then we had a little press release that said ask them what is their name so we can take their name out, and they would hang up because they weren't contributing to us anyway, anyway.<Files\\HM\\HM_Pennick_Aurie> - § 5 references coded  [1.85% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.68% CoverageSo I wanted to again work back like I had as a case worker as opposed to working downtown at Salvation Army, and a job came up.

So that it's all this negative conditioning and just showing the guys you know, the only thing that is important is a woman's booty, you know, or showing the girls that that's the only way they can be important, because I understand the statistics for molestation of young women is really high in the community, and that this has given us an excuse that the black rap music is extolling very low values. That discourages me. Also, 'Oprah' ['The Oprah Winfrey Show'], I was watching 'Oprah' at like one in the morning the other night and she said she started, no this was on the Anderson Cooper show that she started the academy for young women in Johannesburg [South Africa] because she was so tired in going around to the schools and hearing that the students only wanted an iPod or a sneaker, that this was, you know we've become so tied in with having possessions, that education has a very low, and remember when I grew up people would be put down if they wanted to be educated you know too, this was both before the rap and the iPod, but they said you were trying to be white if you were smart,<Files\\HM\\HM_Pratt_Sharon> - § 2 references coded  [0.35% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.35% CoverageSpeaker 2: Well, what I do remember is that sexism was very, very pronounced in the law school.

And it was very hard for us to get called on. You could raise your hand, and they--often the professors ignored you. The only time they wanted to call on you is if it was involving something like rape. You know, it was just unbelievable. It was just so blatant.

Britt Joh- most people never wanted to get their family's wives back once they were kidnapped in that way because it was known that they were raped and soiled, and et cetera. Britt Johnson took three or four years and he got his wife and children, and several of those white women back.Reference 2 - 1.01% Coverage I think that that the one, there was someone in my music career that I should've sued that I was too intimidated to sue who actually, in my opinion, wrongfully gained from my work and one might say that--I'll leave it. And after having gone through that other lawsuit when there was a question of am I gonna let these people intimidate me and have my book ['The Wind Done Gone,' Alice Randall] silenced. And I realized no, I don't care whether it's right in front of the whole country and people--they're calling me a literary parasite. I'm gonna fight for what's right. It made me wish on that other side that I had been--would've been hard to fi- I was willing to, but it was hard to even find a lawyer who wanted to take it on. You know, that, and it was--you know, a lot of the music industry, historically, is set up to exploit writers, particularly poor black and poor white writers. I'm not a poor black or white writer, but it's the exploitation when you work in those fields it's still in, at that time at least there was some of it that was still present. And I wish I had been willing to confront that. And so, I stand that up on the historical. And I may one day be able to right that wrong. I would love to right that and give that money to a foundation that helped--I'm, I'm supporting a group, they're starting to do some support for a group called Lawyers for the Arts [Volunteer Lawyers and Accountants for the Arts]. And I always would like to try to standby helping young artists and writers feel their own agency and feel a right to stand up for their rights. And I encourage--you know, it's harder--and this is something I would like to say for the record for me, is it I think people not understand how much harder it is for black people to go before the law and the court, because we have not always felt we get justice in the courts. And that court is not an easy thing. I read 'To Kill a Mockingbird' [Harper Lee]. It makes white children feel good about Atticus Finch, well what about black people when this poor man is about to be murdered for raping someone he never raped. It's not a happy story, it's a tragic--I mean, I love the book, but it's tragic. And it's differently tragic for a black person. So I was scared when I went to court because I was not--all my white friends including at Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut] were so shocked by Judge Pannell [Charles A. Pannell, Jr.]. I was not expecting him to be that ignorant and it was three white conservative men who freed my book; however, it did not shock me that he would feel the audacity to do this. You know, that, or feel probably the worst how easy and simple it was for him to do it. So, I wish for myself that someone had told me<Files\\HM\\HM_Ransby_Barbara> - § 2 references coded  [1.89% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.49% Coverage I moved here in 1991, and that was the moment that Clarence Thomas was being nominated for the [U.S.] Supreme Court. And I was involved in another national mobilization called African American Women in Defense of Ourselves, which really tried to add a different voice to the debate around Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill. Anita Hill, of course, was the person that accused him of sexual harassment and almost derailed his appointment to the Supreme Court, and she was vilified as someone, you know, who was not trustworthy--she was making this up, she was trying to bring a black man down--and it was a very simplified formula because, of course, Clarence Thomas had, in many ways betrayed the interests of most black people long before Anita Hill's accusations, which I think were quite credible, came to the fore.Reference 2 - 1.40% Coverage I do remember Orlando Patterson from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] wrote a piece in The New York Times which was pretty troubling, describing his take on black male/female relations and framing this alleged sexual harassment in that context. And what his position was, was essentially that this was, that what Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of was a kind of flirtation that was common, and that she should have known that this was harmless flirtation, and not kind of outed him. So, you know, I can't even muster the words to express the extent of my disagreement with that, but that was one pretty vile interpretation. But even people like [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou, for example, supported Clarence Thomas initially, and said, "Look, he comes from a poor black background and if he's in there, if he's in the Supreme Court, his experience as a black man growing up in the South under adverse circumstances, that has got to kick in at some point. That has to have an effect on his judgment." And certainly with all due respect to Maya Angelou, that has not proven to be the case. So, anyway, African American Women in Defense of Ourselves was a group of black women. We mobilized people to raise quite a lot of money in a short amount of time for a national newspaper ad campaign which was, it put an ad in The New York Times and a number of African American papers. We raised about fifty thousand dollars, which was a lot for us at the time. I realize it's probably not now. And sixteen hundred women signed a statement that basically said we felt that black women's voices were not being heard, that Anita Hill was being distorted, and it really was not about supporting Anita Hill in a sort of narrow sense as it was confronting all the misrepresentations of race and gender in the discussion around Clarence Thomas. And it was also indicting, you know, his conservative views as not being in the interest of black folks or poor folks. So that was a major mobilization, it took a lot of time and energy, and it was, you know, it was a success, a limited success. But we made a statement and there was an attempt to organize the women who had signed that ad into an organization after that. And there were networks that emerged and sustained themselves, but not for, you know, very long.<Files\\HM\\HM_Ray_Fay> - § 4 references coded  [3.00% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.45% CoverageSpeaker 2: I caught a freight train and I went there.

But the unfortunate thing was I mixed it all up in a child's imagination. Some of it was the real truth, and some of it was just fantasy.

And she thought that was something was terribly wrong with me. And so she took me to a doctor, and the doctor said, "This child is a virgin. She's making all this stuff up." And so, what should have been believed was not believed, because it just seemed like it was all fantasy, and some of it was and some of it wasn't. But what happened, she talked to a social worker who thought that I should be put into an institution for evaluation. And so I went into this institution, and they misdiagnosed me as mentally ill. And I ended up as one of the early, one of the youngest persons in a mental institution, which was one of those big warehouses they used to have in Ohio.

But anyway, they put me in this mental institution. And there were horrible stories. There was just... there was this big white woman with blonde hair that fondled me once as I tried to go down these, this winding staircases.

And somehow my grandmother, when she visited me, she could understand what she had really done, you know, and she worked to get me out of there. I can't even remember how long I was there. It seemed like maybe it couldn't have been over a couple of months. But it was a horrible, horrible, experience to think that my first experience with writing made me end up in a mental institution. So, you know, for years I never, ever wrote. I went to poetry, but I never did any kind of self-examination again, or I never put myself in stories again, because I just had this very bad experience of what could happen. It would take me maybe forty years again to write anything personal. But it was a horrible experience. It taught me, you know, not to trust, you know.

And Julia Head was a common ancestor of Condoleezza Rice and myself and she was also half white and the family did not ship her out, they kept her as almost a relative and from North Carolina migration out to Birmingham [Alabama] kept Julia. The letters are concerning the fact that Julia, a mulatto slave who was their half-sister just like Sally Hemings was unhappy serving Charlotta [ph.]. So they were having a family conference letter about where to place Julia in another household within the extended family so that Julia would be happier (laughter).

When we told folk, "Look you need to be in this track. These are the courses that can get you into the higher level colleges," and people would say, "We don't want to work that hard," and then we chllenge them even more and they still turn it down. There was no excuse as far as I was concerned. What I see today is also in the black middle class a laziness and I don't forget that they know we know too much. When I'm working with clients in the housing projects and I'm in the underclass areas of white America and black America and Latino America or I'm on the Native American reservations where the deprivation and the poverty are high. When I'm in Appalachia, when I'm in housing projects where you have underclass African Americans and you look at the environmental killers in their environments everything from the nutrition to the lead poisoning to the violence. These are kids who have post-traumatic stress syndrome and absolutely interferes with their ability to understand their choices and then you look at the schools and the quality of their schools and some of these schools couldn't teach the sculptured poodles in Beverly Hills [California] how to bark. Even if you did want those schools offered, you would barely be literate. So their choices are different and the culture that I see developing in underclass communities is devastating but it is a culture that copes with an environment that is so deprived. It's almost gotten to a 'Clockwork Orange' counterculture that you have a cult of violence and children don't see anything else around them. So achievement is neither possible, in fact achievement is now being defined in terms of a prison culture. Achievement is getting into a gang, achievement means getting power so that you don't become a victim of the rape you saw in the hallway.

Orlando Patterson is an expert in slavery and the African diaspora and so I learned the different types of slavery and I learned how most of our predecessors--our ancestors from the African strain of our background came first from the Caribbean. So most slave ships came to the Caribbean and went to South and Central America. Very few actually landed with slave holds that landed in Maryland and Virginia and so forth. So that was one of the surprising things and then of course the different systems of slavery and what that meant for where we came from. My family not only did it have the advantages of being the Sally Hemings in the slave world the bastard children of the owners--slave owners but also a number of Native American relatives in there so for people who had that kind of background and did not have to toil number one in the big farms in Mississippi the huge plantations which were Haitian style. They had the Haitian style of slavery which meant that they didn't care whether you lived or died. You can tell how brutal the farm was by how far away the master lived and most of the farms in Mississippi and Louisiana for example, the master's mansion is not like 'Gone With the Wind' [Margaret Mitchell] with your plantation right there with Scarlett [Scarlett O'Hara] waving happily at her happy slaves. Those slave mansions had to be--slave owner mansions had to be five, six, seven miles away because the farms were so brutal and you had to have black overseers because people were so--people enslaved on those plantations were so brutalized that it didn't even make economic sense to have them breed--to have them reproduce. So the Haitian model which was the most brutal model they simply worked you to death. It was actually worse than how animals were treated.

It was such a terrible story that--of course, I didn't know about it until I was grown up. But I knew that there was always whispering and fear that Aunt Florence might get married. I didn't know why that, I didn't know why this fear was that she might get married. She was a teacher. It seems that there was one doctor, Dr. Martan, who would treat people of African ancestry, he would make home visits. So my, my aunt had this terrible stomach ache, just excruciating. And so my grandmother called Dr. Martan, and he came and he examined her. And he said, "She has appendicitis. And she has to have surgery." My grandmother said, "I can't take her to the hospital," because they always--they knew by rumor what happened. And so he said, "I tell you what you should do. You come to the hospital in the morning. You be there at 9:00 o'clock. Wait for me outside. Don't go in until I come for you." Well, the next morning my grandmother took Aunt Florence to the hospital, of curse, to the back door of the hospital, waiting for Dr. Martan. And eventually this person came out and said Dr. Martan says come in. And my grandmother said, "No. He told me to wait until he came for me." He said, "Well, he's scrubbing up, and he sent for me." So they went in. And they totally, gave her a total hysterectomy. Her stomach looked like a series of zippers. They mutilated her anatomy. When Dr. Martan came, he came outside and said to my grandmother, "Where, where is, where is Florence?" She said, "They said, you said"--he said, "Oh, God, I just came." And when he went in, he told my grandmother what had happened. Story_ID: 12869 Speaker 1: And do you think Dr. Martan--now, was he, he was a white doctor, right? He was a white doctor. Speaker 2: Okay. Speaker 1: And--but the doctors knew that he was to operate. And they knew that my aunt who was a teenager was there for that. So they simply insisted that Dr. Martan had sent for them, and that was a lie. He had not even arrived at the hospital at that point. It ruined not only her life, but the life of the family because it was a disgrace to have had a hysterectomy. The thought was that you would never be attractive to a man, you would never be sensually expressive. And also about that time the strangest thing--and I'm, I'm writing about this, there was a Hollywood star called [Roscoe] 'Fatty' Arbuckle. He raped a young woman, and in raping her, she had had a hysterectomy, and he penetrated the bladder. And she died. So, of course, this is not something that you talk about openly, but the thought was if you've had a hysterectomy, you can never have a normal sexual life because you will be ruptured. They didn't know that a membrane grows, and, of course, they didn't know that the doctors had prepared her inside so that the membrane would grow. They knew nothing about what had happened to her. But they were terrified that if she ever married, and had a sexual relationship, that she would die.

You couldn't marry white, you couldn't marry each other. But it was that man who was spiritually connected to his mother who raised him, taught him his skills as a carpenter, cabinet maker, who loved and educated him. And I often, when I speak to young men of African ancestry, I said, to have children by women for whom you have no affection and have children that you do not expect to educate and nurture, that's not the African thing.

And it came to be known in the tabloids as "The Phantom of the Opera Murder" case. A violinist in the orchestra at the opera disappeared during intermission. And there was a big search, and ultimately, her body was found thrown off the roof and sandwiched between two buildings, kind of thing. In any case, it was a big mystery. And a lot of people who attend the opera are people who either own or edit The New York Times (laughter) or have friends who were there. So it was a big story from the jump because it affected that part of society in New York [New York City, New York]. And it was my story. So I did a lot of interesting stories related to that trial, and my greatest achievement, I think, was when the--we knew when the trial was opening, we knew at that point that the defendant had supposedly confessed. The defendant was a stage hand. And apparently, he had accosted the violinist, and tried to engage her in a romantic liaison. Of course, she was having none of that. And he ended up raping and killing her. Well, we knew that the prosecution said that it had confession, a confession from him, but we didn't know the content of the confession. So jump ahead, we're there at the beginning of the trial, opening statements by the prosecution and the defense. And the prosecutor gets up and tells us what he's going to prove. And he gives a narration of what happened from the time Helen Hagnes Muntiks, I think was the name, from the time she left the orchestra pit to the time her body was found. And as I'm listening to that, I'm thinking, he's telling us the confession. Who else knew this stuff except whoever confessed? So I wrote a story, rushed and wrote a story that said, we finally heard the details of the confession in the opening blah, blah, blah.References 3-4 - 0.47% Coverage I think I learned that valuable lesson there, "Don't let your feelings get in the way.

But I had to hold the emotions in check and focus on the facts.

As you know, 2013 was the year that three women [Gina DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight] were found, you know, to have been locked in a house for a decade. Well, for the last three years, we have been pushing the state to do a better job of examining rape kits and, you know, I think our content, as well as, you know, other developments, have sort of moved the state to a place where it's more effectively and efficiently testing rape kits, and thousands of rapes are being resolved as a result of much of the work that we're doing. And so, you know, we are continuing to push to--particularly, you know, for poor women whose credibility is questionable, they've never--you know, they rarely have been able to get anybody to listen to their cries. And now the state attorney general [Mike DeWine] has made a commitment to testing every untested rape kit that's out there, and there are about four thousand, and they're about a third of the way through. And in some cases, the offenders are in custody; you know, they're right there but no one's ever tested and no one's ever asked, and so for many families, including families who've had people not just rape but murder, some of those murders have been resolved in the past year. In one case, a woman's daughter was killed thirty years ago and just gotten to a place where she knows what happened. But as it relates to the rape kits specifically, there's a twenty year statute of limitations, and so there's this race to get those tested before that statute runs out. Story_ID: 653800 Speaker 1: One of the reasons the whole discussion of the rape kits is important is, if you recall, in 2008, the bodies of eleven dead women were found either in the house or in the yard of a serial killer in Cleveland [Ohio]; his name was Anthony Sowell-- Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous). Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) so if you look on our front page the day that Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] was elected, when you get to the second front page [of The Plain Dealer], you see the developments around the Anthony Sowell murders. And so we had Anthony Sowell and, you know, that's discovered in 2008, and then in (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is an African American man-- Speaker 1: African American man-- Speaker 2: --living in--on the-- Speaker 1: --living on the east side of Cleveland who, you know, murdered women who were, you know, largely drug addicts who didn't necessarily have a lot of credibility with law enforcement. Since that time, other women have come forward to say, "Yes, I reported being raped by him and the police didn't do anything." So that really was the catalyst for this work. And then when you fast forward to 2013 and you see the Gina DeJesus, Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight developments, it just makes the case for why this work is so critically important. So we're--you know, if we have to look at what was our signature content in 2013, in addition to covering the live story of the escape of these women who lived this decade of captivity, it's really the impact of our journalism on the potential to reduce this frm continuing to happen; so, you know, we think that's, we think that's important. Even as we change the way that we're distributing content, we think that deep investigative commitment is our competitive advantage--it's what we can do that nobody else can do in this town.<Files\\HM\\HM_Simpson_Carole> - § 2 references coded  [0.84% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.84% CoverageYes, that's what we did.

Speaker 2: You mean a guy who is guilty of sexual assault? Speaker 1: Well, I mean, keep in mind, universities are not courts of law. They are not judges and juries and often in cases of campus sexual assault, we see that it's his word against hers and there's alcohol involved or other drugs and the credibility of the woman is challenged and, you know, it's, it's a very--as we're--as we still see today, it's an extremely difficult, difficult issue.<Files\\HM\\HM_Thompson_Francesca> - § 2 references coded  [0.72% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.72% CoverageI don't know if you're familiar with that play.

And I got pregnant and that was like--for my mother--that was like, oh my God--and I really--this is the first time I've ever talked about it to anybody--I mean outside--on screen or talked about it historically. I--when my mother found out then that was the first time I'd had a relationship--he took advantage of me and I got pregnant so instead of her--and thank God she didn't now--have an abortion, that was just out because several of my friends and my best friend, who is Dr. Alma George, was the first black woman president of the medical association in Detroit [Michigan], somebody else you should interview. Her father, Dr. P.N. George was my, my doctor and she could have had an abortion but that was--my mother wouldn't hear of that.

I never forget the first time I was at one of these conferences and women were wearing a button with a hanger on it that said, "I had one." Black women don't do that. They talked about abortion in ways that were not comfortable--white women did--for black women, and when I saw--I thought, "Oh, my God. That's not the way to talk about that." But I also knew that black women who didn't talk about abortion knew more about it than they were willing to talk about because, don't forget, I had eavesdropped on my mother's [Velma Lee Moore] conversations with her girlfriends and I knew that there were women in our communities who had all of these homemade remedies for how to abort. I heard women talk about falling down steps, about women taking, douching in lye, about women taking turpentine--I heard all those conversations when I was a young girl, and I knew about midwives who performed abortions by dilating the uterus in St. Louis [Missouri] and in East St. Louis [Illinois]. So I knew that black women had abortions, but I also knew it was a very private thing. It was nothing that they talked about, but I knew that they knew how to do it and much of it was learned during slavery when black women aborted white babies that were the result of basically rapes by white. So I knew that, but I also knew that white women wanted to raise the level of discussion about abortions because they were talking about your right to determine whether or not you could do that. Black women already knew that if they wanted to do it, they were going to do it. It was nobody's business. White women were trying to get it accepted in the medical world. We didn't have the medical world. We didn't have the luxury of fighting for our doctors to do it. We had the ways to get it done and didn't get it done through doctors. This was done through midwives and other kinds of things that women learned how to do. So we were both talking about freedom of choice and the ability to make the decision if you had to, but we were talking about it in different ways, and so I learned early on not to take the language of the white women back to the black community.<Files\\HM\\HM_Watson_Diane> - § 5 references coded  [0.69% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.22% Coverage I think that's what Alex Haley got across in 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family']-- Speaker 1: Absolutely.

And, they just told you that. She adopted her." They would say mean things like that. And, so, that's--was very early on. Story_ID: 667408 Speaker 1: So, that's when my grandmamma [Montine Wilmont] told me the story. "Your granddaddy is white. Your granddaddy discovered more about cancer than anybody--," his father [L.C. Allen] did. And, he--both of 'em were doctors. They owned the clinic in Gainesville [Georgia]. Right--in what you call Hoschton [Georgia]. It's right outside from Gainesville. And, my grandmother, the son was an intern at the time. His father owned the clinic [Hillcrest-Allen Clinic and Hospital, Hoschton, Georgia]. The clinic was next to the house. I went to see the house when I was about ten. And, it was still there. And, it's like a monument or something. And, so, she said, "I went home and I would tell my mother, Mr. Allen's son [Myron B. Allen] keeps bothering me." And, so, the mother said, "He don't want you. You black and you ugly." You know, we, we had person--my grandmother's mother looked like an Indian [Native American]. But, my grand- her father was dark. It's a funny thing in our race, and we're getting back to it now, they still doing it in school. I have a lot of little mentees so this is another story for another time though. I had to go and see about a little girl who they were calling black because her skin color was, was dark. And, so, my grandmother was a beautiful woman but people--we had been, I guess, persecuted so long, we saw black as not being beautiful. We, we couldn't conceptualize and therefore my grandmother went and ironed and my mother, her mother did not recognize she was--my grandmother was 5'2", weighed probably ninety pounds or 100 pounds. And, she kept seeing that my grandmother's stomach was getting a little full. You know, my grandmother was probably about six or seven months pregnant. And, she said, "What is wrong with you?" She said, "I told you Mr. Allen--," and explained to him, her what had happened. And, so, she, my grandmother--all the boys I think were away. Like I told you my grandmother was next to the baby boy. All my grandmother's brothers were in the [U.S.] Army. They were gone away. She went to this doctor's house and told him she was gonna kill him. She had a hatchet. But, they ran her away and she went back home. She said, so, the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] came and got my great-grandmother, I said I'm a write a book, it's a very interesting story-- Speaker 2: It is. Speaker 1: --came and got my grandmother and took her out to a tree and tied her to a tree. And, during those days, my mama said my grandmother wore white cotton stockings, you know, they would do that 'cause she work so hard and had had all those children. I guess she had varicose veins or something. And, she said that they beat her until the skin on her legs rolled down in the stockings. And, said, that--I get emotional when I think about it (crying). But, she told them, she was such a strong woman, she told them, say, "You might kill me but you can't eat me. You--Dr. Allen's son raped my daughter and I entrusted him to go there." She was trying to help the family by ironing clothes and the, the boy who was my mother's father drove up and said, "Let her go." And, she had them put her in his car and he took her back to where she lived and, and treated her. But, when they took the stockings off the skin came off. But, she was bloody everywhere but they said that, and he told this story, said that, to my grandmother, said, "Your mama is some woman." Even in the midst of about ten men beating her, they didn't wanna just kill her. That was too easy. They wanted her to suffer. And, when they told her, she just said, the last thing she said before she passed out, "You can kill me, but you cannot eat me." And, looked them right in the eyes, with the hoods over their faces. And, so, it's like my grandmother had a lot to deal with. Then, Mr.--the doctor wanted to take my mama 'cause she came out white.

I said, "I'm not able to communicate to you exactly what age group or cohort that I would support until I see a total bill. You can't just lift one section and say, 'Yes, I'm going to do this.' I have to see what we could accomplish in the total bill. When a bill is written I'll tell you I'm going to support it, depending on what it looks like in its final version because bills get heavily amended during the Committee process. So, I cannot make you any promise."

You know, very sophisticated networks of perpetrators. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not just one isolated perpetrator that you might have in a domestic violence or a sexual assault case. I mean, sometimes itÃ¢Â€Â™s very similar. So in some kind of trafficking, like for example, domestic workers. A lot of domestic workers are trafficked and exploited, and that might be very similar to a domestic violence case, where itÃ¢Â€Â™s one person that was brought over to be a nanny but then really kept like a prisoner in that home. So in that way, itÃ¢Â€Â™s very similar to the kinds of situation that, say, somebody who married into a family, where the perpetrator was abusive, her partner was abusive, and even the extended family was abusive. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s a lot of parallels there. So both. There are a lot of things that are the same, and a lot that are different. Also the legal recourse is different. What are the legal remedies that trafficking survivors can access? As well as what the legal remedies for domestic violence survivors or sexual assault survivors [are]. KWONReferences 6-8 - 2.06% Coverageaspect of the work. So thatÃ¢Â€Â™s why I would say that a lot of the Asian-based programs for gender-based violence are alsoÃ¢Â€Â”probably if you ask all of them, and now in my new position at API Institute, I see that most all of the community-based groups are working also with trafficking survivors. Whether they advertise that or not, they are. And a lot of the trafficking survivors have the intersection of experience. They have been sexually abused, or they might be children, who grew up with incest or child sexual abuse. They might have been escaping domestic violence or sexual abuse, and then found themselves caught in a trafficking situation, or they mightÃ¢Â€Â™ve been trafficked and then sexually abused or in a domestic violence situation. So the intersection of all these gender-based violences really overlaps a lot, and a lot of them Ã¢Â€Â”the survivorsÃ¢Â€Â”they will tell you the stories of their experience, but theyÃ¢Â€Â™re not going to say, Oh, IÃ¢Â€Â™m a sexual abuse survivor, or, Oh, IÃ¢Â€Â™m a domestic violence survivor, you know? Those are kind of artificial constructs, based on the law or our definitions, but survivors themselves often have the experience of the overlap of different kinds of abuse that theyÃ¢Â€Â™ve experienced.

You can go into pro-choice and reproductive rights, health, or justice work or you can go into anti-violence and domestic violence and sexual assault, rape work. And I had done that [anti-violence] work, so I was like you know, this is the branch of the tree that IÃ¢Â€Â™m doing now, Reference 3 - 0.46% CoverageMINGUS: Yeah, yeah. So thereÃ¢Â€Â™s the intersection of the content, of course. I began just asking questions, and thatÃ¢Â€Â™s how it all started. They would give statistics around forced sterilization or around abortion or around sexual violence of women of color, or you know, all these different groups, and I would always ask, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, what about disabled women?Ã¢Â€Âù or Ã¢Â€ÂœWhat about disabled people?Ã¢Â€Âù And they never had any statistics. References 4-5 - 1.68% CoverageSo my work is in two broad pieces. My work is disability justice, so I apply it all the time there, and then I do transformative justice work. So in that work, I feel likeÃ¢Â€Â”The transformative justice work that I do is around community responses to child sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse is very, very pervasive, and just as the statistics that weÃ¢Â€Â™re given say that people who are identified or assigned as girls are twice as likely to be victims of child sexual abuse, the same statistics are true around disabled children and adults, because thereÃ¢Â€Â™s also developmental stuff that gets complicated. But actually, in terms of gender, we actually think itÃ¢Â€Â™s much moreÃ¢Â€Â”we think itÃ¢Â€Â™s much higher around people who get assigned as boys, too, but that thereÃ¢Â€Â™s less reporting. So itÃ¢Â€Â™s hard to know. I feel like my TJ [transformative justice] around child sexual abuse, or CSA, work is disability justice work, because I know so many people who are survivors of child sexual abuse who are disabled peopleÃ¢Â€Â”myself includedÃ¢Â€Â”and I know so many people whoÃ¢Â€Â”I know that disabled communities donÃ¢Â€Â™t talk it. No communities talk about child sexual abuse. So itÃ¢Â€Â™s not just disabled communities, but given the prevalence, I think that itÃ¢Â€Â™s something that disabled communities should be talking about and that most disabled children donÃ¢Â€Â™t have access to community, donÃ¢Â€Â™t have accessÃ¢Â€Â”ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s just so many more complications around disabled children, I feel like, that get added in around dependency and all that, so I feel like disability justice is certainly a huge piece of that work, too. Reference 6 - 14.23% CoverageMINGUS: ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not an organization. KWON: Oh, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not? MINGUS: ItÃ¢Â€Â™s a collective. So itÃ¢Â€Â™s a group of community folks whoÃ¢Â€Â”I mean, it sounds weird to say weÃ¢Â€Â™re all volunteers because itÃ¢Â€Â™s our lifeÃ¢Â€Â™s work, so itÃ¢Â€Â™s not like a volunteer thing, but none of us get paid currently. We have been meeting for two years. Our goal is to create transformative justice responses to child sexual abuse, so responses that donÃ¢Â€Â™t rely on the State, so people are able to intervene in incidences or cases of child sexual abuse without having to call the police, without having to just send somebody to prison, a response thatÃ¢Â€Â™s not just about resisting violence but also about how do we cultivate and create the world that we want, meaning the things that actually will prevent violence from happeningÃ¢Â€Â”like safety, healing, accountability, transformation, all those things. And so thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the work that weÃ¢Â€Â™re doing. Our vision is a Bay Area where everybody has the skills and the capacity to be able to intervene or prevent an act of or an incident of child sexual abuse. And so our work is a lotÃ¢Â€Â”ItÃ¢Â€Â™s very different. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s alternatives building work. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not direct needs or immediate needs work, which tends to be a lot of responding, responding. Our work isÃ¢Â€Â”I feel like itÃ¢Â€Â™s a lot slower and deeper, and so weÃ¢Â€Â™re working towards supporting our first trial intervention in three years, weÃ¢Â€Â™ll be doing that. Until then, what weÃ¢Â€Â™re doing is, currently right now, we are developing a possible accountability model for TJ intervention in CSA. WeÃ¢Â€Â™ve been studying accountability models and processes that have already taken placeÃ¢Â€Â”many of which are not around child sexual abuse, just given the unique risks involvedÃ¢Â€Â”but seeing whatÃ¢Â€Â™s transferrable and whatÃ¢Â€Â™s not, in terms of interventions that have been successful or where thereÃ¢Â€Â™s pieces of it that have been successful. And so thatÃ¢Â€Â™s one. WeÃ¢Â€Â™ll be having our first draft of that on October 1, which is so exciting. The other big piece is the provider network work that weÃ¢Â€Â™re doing. So the framework that weÃ¢Â€Â™re working in isÃ¢Â€Â”Given where weÃ¢Â€Â™re at, and given where we want to be, obviously we want to be where itÃ¢Â€Â™s like thereÃ¢Â€Â™s healers in every school, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s like accountability circles that are just community run that people do, and everybody knows how to run an accountability process, and you know, people donÃ¢Â€Â™t even need to be held accountable. They take accountability, right? They do something, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re like, I want to take accountability for this, right? ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not like, You did something wrong. Ever. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s where we want to be, and we know that thatÃ¢Â€Â™s a very long way between where we are and where we want to be. So in the mean time, what is the work going to look like? Obviously, we would love to have just a pure TJ intervention that never relies on the State and is totally community based and funded, whatever, but we know that thatÃ¢Â€Â™s notÃ¢Â€Â”We havenÃ¢Â€Â™t built to the scope and scale that would allow for that yet. WeÃ¢Â€Â™re still a relatively small group of people in terms of how large child sexual abuse is when we think of the statistics, which are one in four girls, and one in six boys. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s huge, right? That number. The other piece that we know is most children are abused by people that they know, that serial child sexual abusers are like less than 2%. Most people are sexually abused by people that they know or are in their intimate networks. So we have like the pervasiveness of CSA that weÃ¢Â€Â™re like trying to work on and hopefully end it, not just respond to it, and we havenÃ¢Â€Â™t built to the scope and scale that we want, so how do we leverage whatÃ¢Â€Â™s already here? How do we leverage whatÃ¢Â€Â™s already in place? So the provider network is going to be building a network of providers that weÃ¢ÂÂ™re able to leverage their services in support of interventions. When we look at the landscape of child sexual abuse, we know that by far, the biggest the most significant gap is around offenders. If we think about survivors, bystanders and offenders, we know that the gap of services for offenders is huge. At leastÃ¢Â€Â”even if theyÃ¢Â€Â™re not perfectÃ¢Â€Â”thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a lot more services for survivors, and thereÃ¢Â€Â™s actually some services, a lot more services for by standers, whether itÃ¢Â€Â™s like educational groups, support groups, whatever. But when it comes to offenders, itÃ¢Â€Â™s pretty much like you either get locked up and put in jail, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a lot of pathologizing and therapeutic stuff, and then thereÃ¢Â€Â™s some smaller more innovative things, but thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the biggest gap, so we know that we want to work there, and then in the meantime, how do we leverage whatÃ¢Â€Â™s already existing? For survivors, how do we sort through those services and find which ones are good? Which are the best support groups? Or which of the support groups are trans* friendly? Which of the support groups are not going to tell on you or report you if youÃ¢Â€Â™re undocumented? Which of the support groups are held in accessible spaces, right? All of those things. Who is a gynecologist that we could recommend you to or refer you to that you could actually come out as a CSA survivor and they wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be an asshole to you, or that they would know and be competent around some of the impacts that that might mean for not just your medical health but your emotional health as well and have a good bedside manner around that. So in the provider network, itÃ¢Â€Â™s people who are either aligned with transformative justice, people who are movable, like if thereÃ¢Â€Â™s just one person in the organization, for example, or somebody whoÃ¢Â€Â™s like, Yes, I know, because IÃ¢Â€Â™m seeing firsthand how the system doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t work, I donÃ¢Â€Â™tÃ¢Â€Â”I know we need something different, but I just donÃ¢Â€Â™tÃ¢Â€Â™ have enough education, or people who are just the bests in their fields. So weÃ¢Â€Â™re having our first gathering of that at the end of this week actually, which is super exciting. The other thing that weÃ¢Â€Â™re doing in that provider network is that weÃ¢Â€Â™re we just had our first draft of the system maps, which are visual maps for people to be able to see what the different pathways are if you decide to engage the State, or if somebody elseÃ¢Â€Â”like if your neighbor calls CPS [Child Protective Services] on you. So that you can literally see, Okay, if CPS comes and gets involved, here is what the process looks like. Here is the number of times youÃ¢Â€Â™ll have to show up in court. Here are the decision makers at each step. HereÃ¢Â€Â™s what you need to know in terms of if somebody calls 911 vs. CPS. All of that. So that feels really exciting, too, to use as like a tool to educate people but also, again, like knowing that one of the defining characteristics of living with oppression is that you have to make really hard choices, and the choices you have are not choicesÃ¢Â€Â”I mean you already know the critique of the pro-choice movementÃ¢Â€Â”and theyÃ¢Â€Â™re not always just. So weÃ¢Â€Â™re trying to also figure out how do we work with what we have, knowing that for some people because we havenÃ¢Â€Â™t built to the scope and scale yet thatÃ¢Â€Â”We want to be able to hold survivor healing and maybe even accountability, to be able to hold bystander education and maybe accountability and healing here, too, to be able to hold offender transformation, accountability, all of that. We canÃ¢Â€Â™t hold all of that yet, and we want to get to a place where we can, obviously, so what does it look like in the meantime? So thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the scope of our work right now, which feels exciting. KWON: ItÃ¢Â€Â™s huge. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s a really big vision. MINGUS: Yeah, yeah, but we also think this isÃ¢Â€Â”and I remember coming to this realization when I was doing reproductive justice work in AtlantaÃ¢Â€Â”that a lot of people were not going to the clinic, not because they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have a state issued ID, or because they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have anybody to watch their kid in the middle of the day, or because they were scared that [the providers] were going to be queerphobic or transphobic. A lot of people werenÃ¢Â€Â™t going to seek reproductive health, because they had survived sexual violence and they were like, I just donÃ¢Â€Â™t deal with anything around any of that. I feel like I reallyÃ¢Â€Â”and so many of the people that I talked to and ended up working with had been survivors of child sexual abuse as well, and that that was just something that was a huge barrier around not only them seeking reproductive health services but also in their ability to be able to be involved in a lot of work. A lot of people were still carrying huge amounts of trauma and still had a lot of healing that they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t [do], because they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have access to healing services or anything like that. Coming into the work, I started with the Atlanta Transformative Justice Collaborative, and we partnered with Generation Five, really coming into the work around a clear strategic vision around likeÃ¢Â€Â”Given how prevalent child sexual abuse is and given how devastating the impacts are in our communityÃ¢Â€Â”If it really is one in four girls and one in six boys, and those are just estimates, they say. They actually estimate that itÃ¢Â€Â™s much higher than that, given that most people donÃ¢Â€Â™t even report child sexual abuse. So if we know that itÃ¢Â€Â™s probably higher than one in four girls and one in six boys, given the prevalence, given the lasting impacts that itÃ¢Â€Â™s just had on one person, and then multiplying that by everyone, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not just about impacts on relationships, which directly impact your community, because in my mind, our communities are going to be what holds our revolutions. There is no good organizer in my mind thatÃ¢Â€Â™s also not doing community building, because theyÃ¢Â€Â™re so connected. Community is like the foundation that organizing gets built upon. A lot of thatÃ¢Â€Â™s misogyny and all thatpatriarchal mess that doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t getÃ¢Â€Â”community building doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t get recognized as real work but whatever. But given that, the child sexual abuse then becomes a strategic place to do work on, that then becomes a strategic generational place to do work on, because you can literally see how not just child sexual abuse, but intimate violence as well, but particularly child sexual abuse is passed down generation to generation. So strategically going for that hitting that mark, trying to intervene the cycle around child sexual abuse, which is often times the first place where people are being taught or learning about power and control, learning about oppression. We talk about it as the building blocks of oppression, and the building blocks of what normalizes violence later on, normalizes reproductive violence, [and] normalizes all kinds of other forms of violence. That is the first place where people are learning that consent doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t exist and that their voice does not matter, and [where people are] learning shame about their bodiesÃ¢Â€Â”all of these themes that reproductive justice really heavily hits on and should hit on in my opinion. Child sexual abuse is also a strategic place for organizing and for all of our movements, because itÃ¢Â€Â™s not just about this secret thing that gets hidden that happens in peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s home. The state uses child sexual abuse, whether itÃ¢Â€Â™s rape as a weapon of warÃ¢Â€Â”we know a lot of those rapes happen to children and young women who are not full-grown women yet, and to boys and to people who are not boys or women, who are intersex whatever. We know that the sex work and the sex trafficking that happens around the militarization, and we know the long history of Native American boarding schools and child sexual abuse being used as a tool for colonization, like all of these things. The State obviously doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t haveÃ¢Â€Â”if itÃ¢Â€Â™s using child sexual abuse, it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t have a vested interest in ending it. So I feel like my CSA work actually is a lot about reproductive justice and I bring a lot of my reproductive justice work with me, because I just think theyÃ¢Â€Â™re just so deeply tied, and thereÃ¢Â€Â™s no wayÃ¢Â€Â”itÃ¢Â€Â™s impossible to separate intimate violence, and particularly sexual violence, from reproductive justice anyways. But yeah, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the work that I do now and I feel like thatÃ¢Â€Â™s where my heart really is, because I havenÃ¢Â€Â™t come across a community where child sexual abuse doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t exist, and certainly within Asian women communities, people donÃ¢Â€Â™t talk about child sexual abuse. And yet I meet so many Asian women survivors of CSA all the time, who come up to me after IÃ¢Â€Â™ve spoken somewhere or after they read about my work. They donÃ¢Â€Â™t have anywhere to go. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s no services. Because even those larger services that we were talking about, in that survivor realm, I mean a lot of women of color donÃ¢Â€Â™t even access those services because of the silence and the added targeting that youÃ¢Â€Â™re putting your community at risk and your self at risk for, if you come out as a survivor. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s so many pieces to why I feel really passionate around my CSA work, and then the transformative justice piece of it, I feel is just exactly right on the money, because so many of our folks donÃ¢Â€Â™t report it and donÃ¢Â€Â™tÃ¢Â€Â™ seek services because they are scared of what the state will do. They are scared of deportation, they are scare of people being harassed and beaten again or locked up and taken to prison, or because they canÃ¢Â€Â™t call the cops cause the last time the cops came to their house, they ended up raping them. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s so many things, so it feels like a really natural progression in my mind. I hope that it makes sense in other peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s minds.<Files\\SCAARJ\\SCAARJ_Zia_Helen> - § 3 references coded  [4.92% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.95% CoverageyouÃ¢Â€Â™re silent, people take that as aÃ¢Â€Â”ItÃ¢Â€Â™s just like itÃ¢Â€Â™s in the Vincent Chin case. If we were silent, people would assume that itÃ¢Â€Â™s because we had no problem with it. If youÃ¢Â€Â™re silent, itÃ¢Â€Â™s like the campaign in the beginning against homophobia with HIV and AIDS. Silence equals death. Silence equals death in the LGBT movement, but it also means death to our communities. If weÃ¢Â€Â™re silent, itÃ¢Â€Â™s okay for people to kills us. If weÃ¢Â€Â™re silent, itÃ¢Â€Â™s okay for kids to get bullied in school, Asian kids, because theyÃ¢Â€Â™reÃ¢Â€Â”or Asian American women to be targets of sexual harassment or sexual violence, because weÃ¢Â€Â™re perceived as being passive and not fighting backReference 2 - 2.93% Coverage”Out of the five or six years of working on this Vincent Chin case, we also were building a movement, an Anti-Asian violence movement, and organizations sprang up elsewhere in New York, in Boston. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s a national group in Washington, L.A., San Francisco, and WashingtonÃ¢Â€Â”state of Washington. So there were all these different advocacy groupsÃ¢Â€Â”TexasÃ¢Â€Â”where people Ã¢Â€Â”OhioÃ¢Â€Â”they were just groups that wanted to do something, and we began tracking. So we began tracking incidents of Anti-Asian violence and so things would come up, and they were various cases that were reported. Terrible cases of teenagers who were stabbed to death, five second graders in Stockton, California who were gunned down in their school playground by a white supremacist, cases that would come up all that time. And we started tracking them because there was noÃ¢Â€Â”there was nobody else doing it, so we started doing it. I got to the point where I probably had a list of fifty or a hundred, and it spanned every ethnicity; nobody was free of the violence. So this was the 80s, in the 1980s there wereÃ¢Â€Â”I could recite them by [heart]. I mean, I would talk about them. I knew every word of them. And at a certain point, where I would talk about themÃ¢Â€Â” And every one of these were men. We have 50 or 100 names of incidents weÃ¢Â€Â™re tracking. What did that mean? Why are they all men? Why are they all maleÃ¢Â€Â”except for the five children. I think there were some girls in there. But ones where they were specifically targeted to be bludgeoned to death or something. Most of the cases were men, and we knew their names. And so out of that there were other women, especially here in San Francisco, who was doing work around violence against women. And we asked, Why is it that the hate crimes are towards men? And actually after some digging, we found two Asian names, Asian women, Asian girls. A girl who was found hanging from a tree. She was eight years old or quite young, found raped hanging from a tree, right after Penthouse Magazine had this thing about exotic pornography about Asian women, including a picture of one hanging from a tree. They were all photos of being dead. So who knows about the connection? Reference 3 - 1.03% CoverageSo dealing with immigration for Asian Americans has a lot of layers to it. So I think this is big, and as far as the visibility, what it means is, for Asian Americans, we have to make sure weÃ¢Â€Â™re seen. We have to make sure weÃ¢Â€Â™re heard. We have to talk about it. We have to talk about what it means for Asian American women and bring gender into this, too, because this last wave of migration, worldwide migration of people who have been displaced, was largely a female migration. Women who were dispossessed. And that brings a whole other layer of vulnerability that women have to violence, to less power, to sexual violence, to the need to care for children and parents and because women as caregivers in society, too. So anyway, I would say that that is for now, a huge one.<Files\\SCAL\\SCAL_Ahrens_Lois> - § 5 references coded  [5.89% Coverage]References 1-2 - 3.41% Coverage We organized like, a feminist counseling service out of those different kinds of services and consciousness raising groups and I mean there was just a lot of activity with many, many, many hundreds of women Ã¢Â€Â” all kinds of women Ã¢Â€Â” who were involved in it. All kinds of women and all kinds of points of view that were constantly Ã¢Â€Â”sometimes were working together, sometimes were arguing with each other. I remember someone brought in a copy of Ms. magazine and on the cover of Ms. magazine was this picture of this woman with a black eye and it was first time anybody actually talked about violence against women in that way. There was talk about rape, but not about battery and the person oddly, coincidently, weirdly enough that wrote that article was Del Martin, the same person that started the D.O.B. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s very weird. And so she started the Daughters of Bilitis in like the 1950s and she ended up writing this book called Battered Women and there was this cover of Ms. magazine an article that she wrote. We all started talking about it Ã¢Â€Â” a whole group of us got together Ã¢Â€Â” and we thought we should just keep talking about it and keep talking about it and we did and eventually we decided weÃ¢Â€Â™d start a battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s shelter. At the time there was a battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s shelter in England, in London. There was a battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s shelter in Minneapolis. And there was a battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s shelter in San Francisco. I think there might have been something or other in Boston and that was it for the country. So, we basically just made it up. I mean, we did a lot of reading. We did a lot of talking and we started announcing that we were starting to work on this. And all these women whose mother had been beaten up, whose sisters or themselves just started sort of coming to these meetings and started telling us what was going on. So, we opened this shelter for battered women Ã¢Â€Â” itÃ¢Â€Â™s called the Center for Battered Women Ã¢Â€Â“ it still exists Ã¢Â€Â” and there were three staff members at the time and I was one of them. We started this shelter which started small and now unfortunately, I think is now the biggest shelter I think in the country. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s like just huge, humongous and itÃ¢Â€Â™s not a good thing, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think. So, I did that Ã¢Â€Â”I mean, there was a very long lead up to it, of course, I mean because we had figure out what the hell was going on and we had to train ourselves to do this work. Then over a period of a couple of years the shelter grew and we raised money. Over a period of years what happened was basically Ã¢Â€Â” and this had happened to the rape crisis movement too Ã¢Â€Â” it was changing from a movement into a social service and there were sort of competing ideologies. We always thought that you couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t stop battery without questioning patriarchy Reference 3 - 0.65% CoverageAll that the movement actually changed, was transformed and co-opted [it] into something that was not a political movement. They way it started Ã¢Â€Â” this happened with the rape crisis movement too Ã¢Â€Â” but it absolutely happened with the battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement so that there is no battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement anymore Ã¢Â€Â” what there are is battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s shelters. There are people who are professional people who do this, but theyÃ¢Â€Â™re not doing it, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re not actually acting out of any kind of political context. Reference 4 - 1.21% Coverage But that isnÃ¢Â€Â™t true about women. And I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know the reasons. I mean, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know whether there is a lot more shame Ã¢Â€Â” I mean thatÃ¢Â€Â™s one of the things, I think a lot more shame Ã¢Â€Â” a lot more stigma, a lot more mental illness, you know? Just a lot more things keeping women from being more outward when theyÃ¢Â€Â™re incarcerated. I mean, the incidence of mental illness is huge in prisons Ã¢Â€Â” I mean, itÃ¢Â€Â™s huge anyway Ã¢Â€Â” but itÃ¢Â€Â™s huge in jails. I just read this statistic that seventy-five percent of women in jails have diagnosable mental illness. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s Ã¢Â€Â” thatÃ¢Â€Â™s an intense number. You know, and more than sixty percent have been victims of child abuse and sexual abuse. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s this huge correlation between injection drug use and sexual abuse. And so women, it could be Ã¢Â€Â” are dealing with completely untreated in these prisons Ã¢Â€Â“ completely untreated Ã¢Â€Â” dealing with a kind of, a set of issues that the men arenÃ¢Â€Â™t dealing with. Reference 5 - 0.63% Coverage The only equivalent would be like slavery. But even possibly in slavery there was more humanity between people, depending on the kind of situations, you know what I mean Ã¢Â€Â” if it was two slaves and one master Ã¢Â€Â” well this is one master and thousands of slaves, always. So, if you take that and you take that dynamic and then on top of that, you put women and male guards watching them doing everything that you can imagine, and the kind of sexual abuse and the kind of intimidation that goes on, I mean it is horrific<Files\\SCAL\\SCAL_Newman_Leslea> - § 2 references coded  [2.18% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.38% CoverageWell, of course every writer likes to think that her audience is everyone, but itÃ¢Â€Â™s not true.

[laughs] Reference 2 - 1.80% CoverageOnce, I had an experience that in hindsight IÃ¢Â€Â™m thinking, how did I do this and it was really scary. I was on an airplane and I was sitting next to a young girl, actually a college student, and we were just chatting and she asked me what I did and I said I was a writer, and she asked me what I wrote, and she seemed, you know, like your basic liberal college student so I told her I wrote Heather Has Two Mommies. And she was fine, we talked about it and then something happened and the plane was delayed and we had to land somewhere else and we had to stay over. And you know, I just Ã¢Â€Â“ my maternal instincts said, do you want to get a hotel room together, it would be cheaper and whatever, and I could tell she got really uncomfortable and then when we got off the plane, I saw her like rush to a pay phone and I thought, oh my god is she turning me in?

So it wasn't just us in Boston Ã¢Â€Â“ women wanted to learn about themselves and, again, that feeling that you could, and that you could know and you could share the knowledge.

I had a minor nervous breakdown after that, I had a Ã¢Â€Â“Ã¢Â€Â“ oh my god, I thought I was seeing spiders on the wall. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t do psychedelics ever in my life. I was in a bar just trying to hang out and dance and all of a sudden I thought I saw spiders crawling on the wall, and I was starting to hallucinate, and it was all part of my post-traumatic stress. You know, so, deep fear. They turned against me, and I had suffered at the hands of an attempted gang rape, kidnapping, when I was kidnapped at gunpoint, and being set up to look like a narc in my community, and it worked.

Basically, I write political songs and love songs. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know how to do much else, so Ã¢Â€Â“Ã¢Â€Â“ ah, every now and then I write a funny song, but Ã¢€Â“Ã¢Â€Â“ so I wrote this song called Ã¢Â€ÂœTake Back the Night.Ã¢Â€Âù And the Take Back the Night march had asked me to be one of the performers, and it was the first Take Back the Night march, so I though, Ok, well then, I need to write a song called Ã¢Â€ÂœTake Back the Night.Ã¢Â€Âù So I wrote a song, and it starts out a capella. The lyrics go, Ã¢Â€ÂœTimeÃ¢Â€Â™s ainÃ¢Â€Â™t like they was before / when night comes knockinÃ¢Â€Â™ on my door / IÃ¢Â€Â™d go among the trees / to feel whatÃ¢Â€Â™s dark and heavenly. / No, timeÃ¢Â€Â™s ainÃ¢Â€Â™t like they was before / when night come knockinÃ¢Â€Â™ on my door.Ã¢Â€Âù And then it goes, Ã¢Â€ÂœNo man shall beat his wife on Sundays / or with a stick larger than his thumb. / Napoleonic code says women should be beaten every day like walnut trees. / Women were owned, boughtÃ¢Â€Âù Ã¢Â€Â“Ã¢Â€Â“ oh, I forgot the other line Ã¢Â€Â“Ã¢Â€Â“ Ã¢Â€ÂœWomen were owned, bought, enslaved, and slaughtered. / Our feet were bound, we bound our daughters. / No more will we deny / no more will we be in conspiracyÃ¢Â€Âù Ã¢Â€Â“Ã¢Â€Â“ and thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a lot more lyrics to it, that I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember all, but then it goes, Ã¢Â€ÂœWeÃ¢Â€Â™ve got to say that it is men who violateÃ¢Â€Âù Ã¢Â€Â“Ã¢Â€Â“ terrorize and violate, or something like that. Ã¢Â€ÂœWeÃ¢Â€Â™ve got to say, weÃ¢Â€Â™ve go to say itÃ¢Â€Â™s men. / Men abuse us, terrify us, drowned us at birth, burn us alive, rape and beat us, and they keep us, yeah, they keep us terrorized. / Can you remember ever feeling safe? / Do you remember only feeling scared? / Yes, weÃ¢Â€Â™ve got to, yes, weÃ¢Â€Â™ve got to / take back the night.Ã¢Â€Âù And then, towards the end, it says, Ã¢Â€ÂœIt may not be all men, but you can bet, / itÃ¢Â€Â™s always men who own the night. / When you go home tonight, / some man may try to take your life / and youÃ¢Â€Â™ll have to fight.Ã¢Â€Âù And it repeats the chorus. So, when I was in the Toshi Reagan band Ã¢Â€Â“Ã¢Â€Â“ Toshi Reagan and the Agitones Ã¢Â€Â“Ã¢Â€Â“ we did my songs and ToshiÃ¢Â€Â™s songs, and we did covers, and I presented this song as one that I would like us to do, and one of the band members refused to play it. And I will say this, Toshi did stick up for the song, and it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t Toshi. Toshi did stick up for the song. The other band member said that she didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to offend men, and she thought that the song would offend men. And I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, ok, these are the men that rape and beat us, torture us, drown us alive, burn us. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t care about offending them,Ã¢Â€Âù you know. Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, all men donÃ¢Â€Â™t do that.Ã¢Â€Âù I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœAnd so, at the end of the song, I say, Ã¢Â€Â˜it may not be all men, but you can bet itÃ¢Â€Â™s always men who own the night.Ã¢Â€Â™ IÃ¢Â€Â™ve taken care of those guys who might get their feelings hurt, alright?Ã¢Â€Âù And sheÃ¢Â€Â™s like, Ã¢Â€ÂœI wonÃ¢Â€Â™t do it,Ã¢Â€Âù you know. And Toshi was apologetic, she says, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou know, I canÃ¢Â€Â™t force her to do the song.Ã¢Â€Âù<Files\\SCAL\\SCAL_Shelton_Christine> - § 2 references coded  [1.09% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.09% CoverageAnd, you know where this all is going is, IÃ¢Â€Â™m looking back to find people like yourself who would be interested in bridging what we know in this country and what the rest of the world knows and kind of find common ground for dialogue. I mean, it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t even have to be Ã¢Â€Â“ now one of the biggest issues internationally is sexual harassment because most coaches, especially in Africa, almost, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t even want to put a percentage to it but whether its Egypt, or Algeria, or Morocco, or Namibia, coaches are men. And the sexual harassment in those countries that push women either out of sport because they get pregnant by their coach, or because the harassment becomes rape, is a terrible thing or women to want to do sport, or women to want to do sport and have to go connected to a power issue of sex. And in this country I think that issue is more subtle but I think it goes on here too, so those issues are dialogues across countries that would be really interesting I think, for our students.<Files\\SCAP\\SCAP_Hazeltine_Glenna> - § 2 references coded  [2.71% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.71% Coverage I think that women were at risk sexually.

And so, in part, IÃ¢Â€Â™m guessing, because Smith women are very open with each other. And that was not discussed. I believe it happened, and from my observation of Dartmouth and Amherst -- I donÃ¢Â€Â™t mean to be calling attention to any one particular school -- I know it happened. It was not discussed; it was not talked about.

It was not me. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t recall who it was. And the head resident would organize when they were going to have a workshop at tea, and there were other groups. I think there was a Rape Awareness peer education group that also did tea workshops, and I think there was also a group from the Lesbian and Bisexual Alliance that did similar workshops.<Files\\SCAP\\SCAP_King_Brandy> - § 2 references coded  [6.94% Coverage]References 1-2 - 6.94% Coverage I took a year, and I stayed on campus, and I was a resident coordinator for Wilson House. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think they have that position anymore, but it was basically people who just graduated or were recent graduates, and they were like a head resident, but, like, one step above. So I lived in Wilson for a year. It was the biggest house on campus. I was also in charge of Gardiner and Morrow, but they had their own head residents, but I was kind of their supervisor. So that was a tough year. That was a really tough year. I felt like it was too big of a job for a 22-year-old to do. I felt like they were jumping from being, you know, just a student to then realizing all of the problems that students are struggling with was very eye opening. I mean, in the one year that I did that, we dealt with vandalism, rape threats, suicide threats, cutting, alcoholism. I mean, I really Ã¢Â€Â” like, racial slurs. It was very eye opening to me, because youÃ¢Â€Â™re kind of Ã¢Â€Â”Ã‚ when youÃ¢Â€Â™re in the bubble, youÃ¢Â€Â™re even in your own bubble, not even just in Smith but youÃ¢Â€Â™re in your own, individual, focused on yourself bubble that I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think I realized that all that was going on. <Files\\SCAP\\SCAP_LaBarbera_Jen> - § 4 references coded  [34.98% Coverage]References 1-2 - 5.17% Coveragell say is that Smith as a womenÃ¢Â€Â™s college also for me was always fairly synonymous with Smith being a fairly feminist space and that was Ã¢Â€Â” thatÃ¢Â€Â™s something that IÃ¢Â€Â™m really proud of for Smith. From my time at Smith and from what I know of the current environment, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s huge for me. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s my main source of pride as a Smithie is that all of my Smith friends are feminists. CLERK: What organizations were you a part of? LABARBERA: I joined Ã¢Â€Â” they may have different names now but I was active in a number of organizations and those were Vox which is the pro-choice group, AWARE which was Activist Women Advocating for Rape Education so it was the anti-sexual violence group, Feminists of Smith Unite and a little bit, just kind of ancillary, involved with Prism which was the queer people of color group. And then I became the co-president, I guess co-president. I might have ended up kind of being the president of Vox and then was the secretary/executive board for AWARE my senior year. References 3-4 - 29.81% Coverage I will say I was always fairly queer-oriented and kind of progressively so even in just those two years. It was progressively more and more queer which probably is reflective of we were probably all getting a little bit queerer every day. It was also fairly, although not perfectly, intersectional and trying to lift up voices of people of color and lower-income students. That was something that we tried to do with varying levels of success as far as leadership of the orgs goes. There was one incident Ã¢Â€Â” and I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know if this is really feminist dialogue Ã¢Â€Â” but my senior year we always put up the Clothesline Project around Seelye Lawn. That was the T-shirt project where survivors of sexual violence create a T-shirt and put whatever they want on it. If itÃ¢Â€Â™s a letter to their perpetrator or just a description of their feelings or an artistic whatever. And so that year we hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t put any out or put any in storage and I think we had 400 or so T-shirts. This was Spring of 2007. We were getting ready to put them up Ã¢Â€Â” or maybe we already put them up and there was, of course, this was the time of the Daily Jolt which was this horrible, anonymous online message board that was mostly an avenue for bullying. It was sometimes informative but primarily it was just mean messages because you could hide behind anonymity and thatÃ¢Â€Â™s what people do. Somebody had posted this message that as Ã¢Â€Â” and by Ã¢Â€ÂœweÃ¢Â€Âù I mean AWARE so AWARE was the organization that put up the Clothesline Project. They put up this post about Ã¢Â€Â” critiquing AWARE for putting the Clothesline Project up in the middle of campus because as a survivor it triggered them and they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to be triggered on the way to the library. They wished that we could have just put it away in a room somewhere. They werenÃ¢Â€Â™t saying that we shouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t put it up at all but Ã¢Â€ÂœCanÃ¢Â€Â™t you put it somewhere more discreet?Ã¢Â€Âù To us it felt very much like Ã¢Â€Â” and the idea behind the Clothesline Project is that whole notion of Ã¢Â€ÂœDonÃ¢Â€Â™t air your dirty laundry.Ã¢Â€Âù DonÃ¢Â€Â™t talk about sexual violence in public because itÃ¢Â€Â™s not polite and it makes people uncomfortable. And so thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the whole point of the Clothesline Project is to be out and in public and to be visible. And so it was difficult to respond to because it was coming from a fellow survivor. There was compassion and we had done everything that we thought that we could do. We had a table that was always staffed right out in the Clothesline Project. We had counselors on-call at the medical center. We had set up a little safe space/decompressing space/processing space either in Seelye or the library. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember. So we had done everything that we thought we could do to support survivors in putting this thing up in public but it still created this huge backlash from this person and then from other non-survivors who also just didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to deal with the fact that sexual violence happens, who didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want it to be in such a public space. So as the Board of AWARE we wrote an editorial to the Sophian in response and also put something up on the Daily Jolt which was then just trolled again because thatÃ¢Â€Â™s what happens. But we did also send that to the Sophian and it was published in the newspaper. And then somebody also got upset because the Ã¢Â€Â” I think this might have been my junior year or my senior year. They blur together Ã¢Â€Â” but we had done a speak-out on one of the nights of Sexual Assault Awareness week and we had a speak-out on the steps of the campus center. We had amplified sounds. We had a little microphone bullhorn thing and people telling their stories. You could kind of hear it a little bit on the other side of Chapin lawn but for the most part you could only really hear it in that one space. And so we had gotten critiqued for that as well because somebody was, like, Ã¢Â€ÂœI was just on my way back home and there I was listening to somebodyÃ¢Â€Â™s rape story and I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t ask for that.Ã¢Â€Âù And I was, like, Ã¢Â€ÂœCool. None of us asked to be violated either.Ã¢Â€Âù It created this weird schism of everybody trying to support survivors in different ways but clashing in really painful and really difficult ways. Somebody who was not a survivor who was trying to speak for all the survivors in her life wrote another editorial to the Sophian. It was basically a battle of editorials citing super antifeminist scholars about how we were inflating the statistics of sexual violence anyway and not that many people are really victims and survivors. Saying that we were exaggerating it and that we shouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be so public about it basically. And that Spring Dorothy Allison, who is an incredible feminist writer, came to campus and we ended up talking to her about it and she read both of them and was totally on our side. But it was a really difficult conversation to navigate because as AWARE we were also really protective of what we were doing and really defensive of the ways that we were going about bringing light to this issue of sexual violence. I think this is one of the down sides of being on a womenÃ¢Â€Â™s college campus. People think that it just doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t happen here. The rates are lower, yes, but it does still happen and itÃ¢Â€Â™s not just UMass Amherst [University of Massachusetts Amhers] kids coming over and committing sexual violence. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s people on campus, too. The feminist dialogue on campus became really contentious for a little bit. And then, as things happen at Smith, it blew over eventually within a week and people were talking about other things. That one week we spent a lot of hours in my friend CaraÃ¢Â€Â™s room in Park House just writing and rewriting and rewriting letters and public statements and things that we could say and do to try to mitigate what was happening.<Files\\SCAP\\SCAP_Lewis_Sylvia> - § 1 reference coded  [2.06% Coverage]Reference 1 - 2.06% Coverage LEWIS: One of the ones that -- actually it wasn't -- I'm not even thinking of the speaker series as much, but I'll tell you one of the things that I really thought was wonderful and that was the exposure to a lot of foreign films we had. I don't know if you have ever seen Sophia Loren in Two Women. This is a classic, classic film. I mean it's pretty gritty. It's about rape in a wartime situation and the visual imagery is very scary. It's done in black and white.

GOLDMAN: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) MCNULTY: Politically. There was some organizing around sexual violence. The party line of the college at the time was that there was no rape on campus or there was no sexual violence here, which, based on my own experience, and that of my friends, I knew was complete bullshit. So there was some Ã¢Â€Â” sorry Ã¢Â€Â” agitation about improving campus security. And they did make some changes, like put up Ã¢Â€Â” we had blue boxes. You know, every half-mile, there was a blue box, just in case when you got attacked, you were right next to a blue box. But I think that was about it. I canÃ¢Â€Â™t remember anything else, at the time. GOLDMAN: If you donÃ¢Â€Â™t mind me asking, like, what Ã¢Â€Â” how Ã¢Â€Â” what was the student perspective, or Ã¢Â€Â” with you, between you and your friends, and, like, noticing that the administration was maybe denying the fact that there was (inaudible) Ã¢Â€Â” MCNULTY: We didnÃ¢Â€Â™t talk about it very much. There was a lot of what has since been labeled date rape going on. Just really ugly stuff. Now, maybe, because when I was in college here, the drinking age was eighteen. So youÃ¢Â€Â™d have college boys Ã¢Â€Â” young men Ã¢Â€Â” coming in for the house parties. And there was just no control over drinking, at all. Everybody was of age, but there were no drink limits, no drink tickets. It was just a beer bathtub; everyone just completely getting drunk. And so, there were a lot of unpleasant situations at best, and I think a lot of what we would call now rape situations. And I know I came home one night from a party in the quad, and a group of very drunk men followed me. And I had made one of them angry at a dance, because I refused to dance with him. I said IÃ¢Â€Â™d rather dance with my girlfriends. And I was probably not very nice when I said it. And they followed me home, and they tried to follow me into the house and attack me. And it was only because one of them Ã¢Â€Â” I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know who it was, but he reached out, and he pulled the door closed, so they were all outside, and I was locked inside. But that was not uncommon. GOLDMAN: And the administrationÃ¢Â€Â“ MCNULTY: I did call security, but not till the next morning. I was so scared, I spent part of the night Ã¢Â€Â” we used to have phone booths on the first floor of the houses, so I just huddled down in the phone booth. And I called my aunt and uncle, who lived in New Haven, and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœCan I come see you right away?Ã¢Â€Âù So I left campus. And then I notified security, and of course, what are they going to do at that point? They were long gone. And they were very Ã¢Â€Â” security was nice; sympathetic. But they couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t do anything at that point. But I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think I told anybody that happened. I was ashamed of myself. Why? I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know. GOLDMAN: Not an uncommon [feeling?]. MCNULTY: No, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not. I understand that. GOLDMAN: Yeah. Yeah, so the administration hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t set up anyÃ¢Â€Â“ MCNULTY: No. GOLDMAN: Ã¢Â€Â“ways of dealing with that? MCNULTY: Probably they would have offered me counseling or something, and informed other students. There was no reporting to other students when there was an incident on campus. Nobody was notified.<Files\\SCAP\\SCAP_Rothblum_Esther> - § 1 reference coded  [0.53% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.53% CoverageYeah, so Vermont had so many lesbian groups and a newsletter and lesbians working in feminist groups like the rape crisis center and the battered womenÃ¢Â€Â™s shelter.

I canÃ¢Â€Â™t remember when, and I remember a take back the night, and I couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t tell you what year it had been, but in the community, and that was a big doing on-call overnight on-call for hotline for the Rape Crisis Center at UMass.

Rosary Hill was, as I said, in the suburbs, and there was no transportation. The buses ran, but they stopped at a certain hour. Buses didnÃ¢Â€Â™t even run, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think, on the weekends. So the college culture in Buffalo Ã¢Â€Â” not just at Rosary Hill, and probably in the United States, I would imagine Ã¢Â€Â” was you hitchhiked. I remember hitchhiking from Buffalo to Albany to go see somebody. You know, we were hitchhiking together. My first years, before I moved off campus, I had a job off campus, and I would hitchhike to that job, and once a guy exposed himself.

(laughter) ACEY: It had a nice little leather holder. ANDERSON: Yes, I was going to say. ACEY: I forgot about that too. God, you know, the things that come back to you are amazing. So it was a culture of hitchhiking, and people were careful. I eventually stopped hitchhiking by myself. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t think it was such a cool, you know Ã¢Â€Â” But sometimes you just got desperate though, you had to get someplace. Nobody had the money to have cabs, and it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t like New York where you just, you know, put your hand out. My sister and her roommate were going out for the evening to a bar, and they left campus and they hitchhiked. They got picked up by two guys, who drove them near where they were going, but pulled into the driveway at the state hospital, which is this big Ã¢Â€Â” massive acres and trees and deserted and dark Ã¢Â€Â” you know, long driveway. My sister and her roommate were in the back seat of a two-door car, and when they went to let them out, her roommate got out, they pushed her, and they drove off.

SheÃ¢Â€Â™d been found in a park. There was an alert out, that she was in a park that was closed, with these guys, and the police were just doing a routine run-by of the park, and they saw this car and they investigated. So my sister was traumatized. There was a woman police officer talking to her and then to me. The guys who had done this were African American, and the police were saying some really outrageous Ã¢Â€Â” So it was this, really, another one of those conflict-ridden, contradictory situations where both she, who is, like, bruised and beaten Ã¢Â€Â” She was a virgin. She might have been a sophomore or a freshman. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know, (inaudible) personal history, anyway. So we got into an argument with the police officer, who had begun to make some racist statements, and I made the comment that, Ã¢Â€ÂœHow can you say this? I was with friends, this jacket belongs to my friend.Ã¢Â€Âù So I just said to them, Ã¢Â€ÂœLetÃ¢Â€Â™s just leave this, letÃ¢Â€Â™s just get out,Ã¢Â€Âù because she had to get to the hospital, get all these tests. WeÃ¢Â€Â™re talking late Ã¢Â€Â™60s, maybe 1970s. I canÃ¢Â€Â™t remember if I was of legal age, because I am a year older, but we basically didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want my parents to know what happened to my sister, because we felt it would kill them, knowing that sheÃ¢Â€Â™d been raped and brutally beaten. To this day we donÃ¢Â€Â™t know. There were all kinds of knives and axes in the car, so we donÃ¢Â€Â™t know if they intended to kill Ã¢Â€Â” ANDERSON: So you were trying to protect your parents from the pain of that. ACEY: We were trying to protect my parents, which was, you know, probably the very wrong thing to do. And then within days, my mother and my aunt were coming to visit, and now this became a big thing. There was a big newspaper article that someone had been raped from campus. Nobody knew, so there was all this buzz on the campus. My sister is not in a great shape, weÃ¢Â€Â™re trying to keep this from our parents. My aunt and mother arrive, and we go out and do something and we come back to my sisterÃ¢Â€Â™s room, and sheÃ¢Â€Â™s on the phone sobbing. What the police had done is to call my father and told him that his daughter was brutally beaten and raped, and his other daughter Ã¢Â€Â” they made up some kind of story, and I canÃ¢Â€Â™t remember. Again, IÃ¢Â€Â™d have to ask my sister exactly how it went, but they got in that his other daughter Ã¢Â€Â” they got in the leather jacket and all that, but they kind of made it something else. ANDERSON: And African American friends too. ACEY: Yeah, they kind of made it an ugly story rather than how it was. So then here we are, my mother and Anna want to know whatÃ¢Â€Â™s happened and why was my sister crying. So that was like completely Ã¢Â€Â” And Joanne, well, she had to go through three trials. She already had left Buffalo and gone off to graduate school, and they were flying her back. I think the first trial was a hung jury, and the second trial they were convicted, but then they got off on a technicality, an appeal. And then there was a third trial, at which they were, in fact, convicted. One, I think, ended up serving a few months, the other a year. So, ah, it was, you know, a big thing. I think I went through a lot of denial, you know? ANDERSON: Yeah. ACEY: A number of years later, I began to be more in touch with the feelings about it. Now I Ã¢Â€Â” you know, fast forward Ã¢Â€Â” I have become involved in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, through reproductive rights and sterilization abuse work, and then anti-sterilization abuse, and also antiviolence, womenÃ¢Â€Â™s antiviolence work, mostly around sexual assault and rape, but also somewhat around battered women. They were different organizations at that time, but the women who were doing the antiviolence work were very connected. Some are involved in both. So it was years later that I got more connected to what had happened, because I think I went into a very Ã¢Â€Â” denial: [it] happened, [itÃ¢Â€Â™s] over. You know, I felt like my sister needed to get some help. Initially she did a little counseling, but she really never, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t feel Ã¢Â€Â” The resources werenÃ¢Â€Â™t there. She was treated terribly by the defense attorneys, treated terribly by the medical folks. There was no one place that I feel she got what she needed, and I think even from me. My parents were devastated, but again, there wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t a lot of discussion about it. So years later I got more in touch with what had happened, kindof the hugeness of it. ANDERSON: Through the movement or through other personal work or therapy? ACEY: In working within the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s antiviolence movement. By the time I got involved with it, there were many lesbians, women of color. It was about organizing and advocacy but also services, but it was also about personal. So the more exposed I got to people working, but also women who had experienced some violence, the closer it got me to, like, begin to get better in touch and to begin to take in that experience in a whole different way. I remember distinctly one conference where there was a session that was women of color only, to talk personally. The opening question was, WeÃ¢Â€Â™re going to go around the room, and I want each person to Ã¢Â€Â” if they can Ã¢Â€Â” relate an experience of their own or of someone close to them or one they know. I remember there might have been about 40 women in the room. Every single woman had a story, and I was totally overwhelmed by it. Again, this is years later. WeÃ¢Â€Â™re maybe talking at least ten years later, if not more Ã¢Â€Â” probably more Ã¢Â€Â” since my sisterÃ¢Â€Â™s rape. I just remember just sobbing and sobbing, and then I started to talk a little more to my sister. Well, now weÃ¢Â€Â™re talking, you know, well over 30 years ago. It still feels like it didnÃ¢Â€Â™t get completely processed, if you will, so. References 5-6 - 1.12% Coverage So it was in New York that I really came into feminism. At first I got involved in CARASA [Coalition for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse], and then I got involved with New York Women Against Rape. You know, besides the student politics, there was a group of us that started a journal called Catalyst: A Socialist Journal of the Social Services. And I think we changed it to the Human Services. So that was one piece of work. I did a lot of other pieces of organizing, kind of in and out Ã¢Â€Â” Farm workers. Later on Ã¢Â€Â” I was already out of school Ã¢Â€Â” but anti-apartheid. I kind of was touching down in different places. Kind of Catalyst was an anchor of doing some work. I did a lot of different study groups Ã¢Â€Â” feminist study groups, political economy. I loved the study group thing because you kind of, like, read and talk to people, sharpen Ã¢Â€Â“ ANDERSON: Did you do more study groups than c.r. [consciousness-raising] groups? ACEY: There were more study groups than c.r. groups, but I did some c.r. groups with different groupings of people. So a couple of c.r. groups, and then there was one c.r. group which was kind of a c.r. group but really, we read, we socialized, we did c.r. It kind of was more of a blend, and that pretty much Ã¢Â€Â” you know, into the Ã¢Â€Â™70s and right into the Ã¢Â€Â™80s, quite a bit of that. Some of my groups were really small, not the political economy. One group Ã¢Â€Â” there was five of us, and we worked with a mentor to really read all of Marx. Another group was a feminist. We looked at the movement, we read articles, books, had discussions, potlucks. Another group was more like a feminist support group, and was the political kind. So there was always at least one going on, if not two, for a number of years, and they kind of stretched out. Then I got very involved in New York Women Against Rape.References 7-8 - 1.91% CoverageSo this whole other world just became Ã¢Â€Â” ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s one of the reasons I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think I could leave when it was time for me to go back to Buffalo. So then I got involved Ã¢Â€Â” again, through friends in graduate school who were feminists and involved in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement. I went to CARASA meetings. I got involved with the New York Women Against Rape. I was still doing Catalyst and some other things and, of course, doing radical things within the area of social work. We formed different groups here and there. Farm workers. So there was a lot of different things (inaudible). CARASA and New York Women Against Rape really got me more exposed to becoming friends with lesbians. Through other friends, I became friends with this couple, who were Ã¢Â€Â” they were just in New York recently Ã¢Â€Â” and one of them became like my confidant. I began to experience feelings towards women that werenÃ¢Â€Â™t just, you know, nice and cuddly. I remember I was doing a group summer house with a bunch of friends, nd somebody that somebody knew was also sharing the house, who we had met. I remember halfway through the summer, I woke up and all I could think about was this womanÃ¢Â€Â™s breasts. I was terrified, like, What the hell is going on? And then I was introduced to womenÃ¢Â€Â™s music. You know, Chris Williamson and Holly Near and Ronnie Gilbert, and I was like, Wow, hmm. For me, I was like, soul music and jazz. I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t one of those Ã¢Â€Â™60s kids that was into rock and roll. It was like, soul music and jazz, and once in a while a little classical because I took piano lessons and I had to Ã¢Â€Â“ ANDERSON: Well, did you like the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s music? ACEY: Well, I did in the beginning, because I was coming out, I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t know it. So it was like, you know, Holly Near, Ã¢Â€ÂœImagine My Surprise!Ã¢Â€Âù Then Diana Ross, Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™m Coming Out,Ã¢Â€Âù you know, I was lip syncing all the time. So there was CARASA and New York Women Against Rape, and then I developed a crush on somebody, and I finally was able to, kind of, after months and months of discussions with my friend, who was like, If you donÃ¢Â€Â™t do this IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to kill myself. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s like, IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to ask her. So we were off and running. I kind of came out and was going through that process in the late Ã¢Â€Â™70s but by Ã¢Â€Â™80 I was out, but it was out in a very personal way, it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t political. And so then, being in CARASA and New York Women Against Rape, and then that was my coming out relationship. But then at the time, I was very involved with New York Women Against Rape, and so was the woman who I eventually ended up with for a number of years, Stephanie Roth, who was the co-director with Sandra Camacho eventually. Sandra died a number of years back, in her forties, of ovarian cancer. You know, involved and met many friends. If I start to mention people, IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to leave them out, but so many people that are, like, part of my life today. Within CARASA, within New York Women Against Rape, there was a very strong lesbian presence, a very radical presence. There was a very strong women of color presence, even more so in New York Women Against Rape than CARASA. References 9-10 - 0.23% Coverage And so there was the reading. I was very fortunate to be in the different study groups, but also CARASA and New York Women Against Rape. There were many meetings, there were lesbian caucuses, women of color caucuses, and thatÃ¢Â€Â™s where I really was able to come to an understanding around my own racial identity and racial politics that were not framed only in black and white.References 11-12 - 0.10% Coverage So it was a big decision to leave North Star and go to Astraea, but I did it. In AstraeaÃ¢Â€Â™s office, actually we shared space with New York Women Against Rape. References 13-14 - 0.17% Coverage So I was the first staff person hired, and we shared Ã¢Â€Â” We had a little office space within the offices of New York Women Against Rape, which is basically in the same building that I had been working in at North Star and the Funding Exchange Ã¢Â€Â” so still in the same spot.<Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Alexander_Dolores> - § 2 references coded  [0.35% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.35% CoverageALEXANDER: How did I get involved? Susan Brownmiller and I were good friends by that time. This was 1979 and we had worked in New York Radical Feminists, we had worked on a number of things together and she had written about pornography in her book, in her book on rape, Against Our Will. And she had gone out to California where she met a group of young women who were involved in Take Back the Night actions and things like that, who were working against violence against women and who also had taken up this pornography, the anti-pornography issue.<Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Allison_Dorothy> - § 20 references coded  [7.63% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.48% CoverageOh, it was the counseling department. My sister had called me. My little sister was Ã¢Â€Â” Trouble was happening, and she was out of the house and called me. And I, for a moment, foolishly thought, I can ask these people for help. Which is stupid and I should have known better. Instead, their response was this wave Ã¢Â€Â” As soon as I began to hint at the full dimensions of what the problem was Ã¢Â€Â” which is, essentially, that my stepfather was after my little sister Ã¢Â€Â” they panicked. The mental health people there really didnÃ¢Â€Â™t know how to deal with it. And so their response was that I was hysterical and that that meant I was not necessarily a good scholarship student. I had been sobbing, and IÃ¢Â€Â™m sitting with this woman, and I remember that it suddenly hit me: YouÃ¢Â€Â™re not like these people. Shut up, wipe your face, and get out of here. And cleaning it up as best I could. When I went to the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s meeting, I had the same response: These people can afford to talk about this stuff, but I could lose my scholarship and be on the street. So I walked out, then didnÃ¢Â€Â™t go back. And itÃ¢Â€Â™s that whole thing of, this is what the middle-class women are going to do, and thatÃ¢Â€Â™s all very well and good, but people like me, no, for three reasons: one, incest; two, violence; and three, being queer.Reference 2 - 1.44% CoverageAnd I think it was the second or third woman that spoke that just killed me, because it was one of the secretary-looking women Ã¢Â€Â” very well dressed, lots of makeup Ã¢Â€Â” took hold of that shell like it was a life raft, and started talking almost immediately about, she needed help because, you know, she looked good, she was in control, everything was working. But she woke up in the middle of the night every night Ã¢Â€Â” every fucking night Ã¢Â€Â” wanting to get up and go drive to Georgia and kill her father. And then she said why. And no person in my life or anywhere in my imagination had ever said it out loud. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t think you could say it loud and still live. And that she was so different from me confounded it. It just changed everything. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s this thing that happens. I had gotten used to, as a kid, to moving a lot. I was used to the phenomenon of, land in a new place, present yourself. You always have a story. And I played, when I was young, with being different people when we Ã¢Â€Â” because we moved every six months or less. So I was used to the present-yourself. I always had a draft of myself, and I designed the story I told about myself for what I wanted Ã¢Â€Â” mostly to be taken seriously. But the moment she started talking, the self that I had been preparing to present, which was about looking good to that woman in that beanbag chair, disappeared. Everything disappeared, and it was like, I am not ready to talk about this, but IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to keep coming back and figure out how to talk about this, and how to make a difference. ANDERSON: How long did it take before you were able to talk about it in that group? ALLISON: Whew! Well, probably about the same time I started sleeping with the girl in the beanbag chair. A couple weeks, not long, not long. Although the way I talked about it was very careful, very careful. ANDERSON: What were you censoring? ALLISON: How complicated incest really is. I was actually censoring who I was, trying to present as middle class, because I had a college education and I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to be my mother or my sisters, and doing fairly Ã¢Â€Â” what I thought was a fairly good job of presenting as middle class. I had a job with the Social Security Administration. I did not wear high heels, but still, I could look like a secretary, and I was trying. It would be three years before I would ever really get to the place where I was talking nakedly. And it would be a decade before I could really Ã¢Â€Â” before that stuff all cracked and I could really look at it and talk about it frankly. There was just no language. And all the stuff that was deeply complicated about Ã¢Â€Â” was impossible to talk about quickly. Sometimes you have to wait for the culture to catch up with you. The thing that nearly destroyed me, both as a kid and as a young adult, was that being raped could provoke a sexual response, and that you could eroticize violence, which is exactly how I survived. I understand a lot of it now Ã¢Â€Â” IÃ¢Â€Â™m 58 years old Ã¢Â€Â” but I did not understand it back then, and I could not have articulated it. But it does inculcate an enormous amount of self-hatred, and thatÃ¢Â€Â™s dangerous to talk about. And even when you can talk about it, I talked about it in very structured, abbreviated ways. And letÃ¢Â€Â™s be frank, the early womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement was a movement of slogans and simplicity, and I was not simple and I hated slogans. ANDERSON: Yeah. ALLISON: Yeah. ANDERSON: Yeah. But you still broke the silence for the first time around (inaudible) that CR group. ALLISON: And thatÃ¢Â€Â™s, I think, what triggers a lot of energy and empowerment, and then the long, slow process of actually sorting through all that stuff and starting to make changes in your life. That takes a lot Ã¢Â€Â“ ANDERSON: Yeah. ALLISON: A lot. The womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement was ready for a lot of what I was ready for, but there were some things I was ready for that the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement was not yet ready for. Reference 3 - 0.23% CoverageA lot of my stuff was centered on the Tallahassee campus, which was central to Tallahassee itself, because it was Ã¢Â€Â” you could walk from the campus to the capitol building, and we did frequently, with hundreds of us, and banners, and demonstrating for everything from the ERA to trying to get services on campus: childcare, rape crisis, the early antiviolence movement, peer counseling. There was a lot of emphasis on peer counseling because this was still back when lesbians and queers were Ã¢Â€Â” you were crazy. And it was still that old thing that had hit me when I was in college, which was, if you identify as a lesbian, you become a pervert.Reference 4 - 0.47% CoverageThere was an attempt to organize the waitress union. It was the first time, really, that there was any outreach to the women of color in Tallahassee Ã¢Â€Â” hugely segregated city. But I had been a waitress Ã¢Â€Â” thatÃ¢Â€Â™s how I got through college Ã¢Â€Â” and I always knew that thatÃ¢Â€Â™s where I would have to go back. So I believed in the waitress union, and I was really pushing for it. I think in part I got the WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Center invested in it because I had pushed for it. And it blew up completely because, in fact, the university threatened to shut the WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Center down. Now there was a lot of stuff that we had done that they had let slide, but that union-organizing effort Ã¢Â€Â” they were going to shut the WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Center down. We had to pull it out of the WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Center or lose the WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Center. And that was one of the times when I thought, Okay, class is the biggie here, because thatÃ¢Â€Â™s exact Ã¢Â€Â” You know, all this other stuff Ã¢Â€Â” rape crisis, childcare Ã¢Â€Â” now, these are cross-class issues. But when you talk about a waitress union, youÃ¢Â€Â™re talking about a working-class issue, and youÃ¢Â€Â™re talking about working with black women, and that was where both the university administration and a lot of people in the WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Center panicked.Reference 5 - 0.27% Coverage We could talk theory. But up in Vermont, all of a sudden that dorm, with people talking about language and what made you uncomfortable. And all of a sudden it was like another light came on in the room, and I could see another corner that I hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t really been paying much attention to, but which I had been dealing with for years. But all of a sudden itÃ¢Â€Â™s like all of these points where I panic, where I back up, where I start pretending and hiding, almost all of these are class-based or incest-based sex stuff. That deep sense of shame that I was born with, I did not actually have to continue to carry. I could actually use it to batter the people about me, and I did. (laughs) Which is, of course, the hard and tricky partReference 6 - 0.21% Coverage No, no, separate. I actually did work with D.C. Rape Crisis too. ANDERSON: Did you? ALLISON: Yeah. I wound up working with a lot of rape crisis, because a lot of family violence and incest is subsumed under those services. ANDERSON: Right. ALLISON: And I was continuing to try to attend groups and find some way to articulate that, and to try to look at it. Incest is nasty and complicated. And I was still dating girls who occasionally put me in the hospital. I needed the antiviolence movement on a lot of different levels, so a lot of work with that, always peculiar.Reference 7 - 0.11% CoverageAnd there was just such a horror, especially since, at the same time, I was working in the anti-rape movement and in the shelter movement, but in the shelter movement was where I would find women who could talk about it, and who could talk about falling in love with somebody who would slap you. Reference 8 - 0.70% CoverageNow, we had been making these things work by raising money on a constant basis. But suddenly there was money available from the government, and they could write a proposal, and they had an institution that looked really good and socially respectable, much more so than our lesbian, fly-by-night camp that put the thing in place in the first place, and they took it over. The same thing happened with a lot of the rape crisis stuff. So a lot of things that we developed, we Ã¢Â€Â” feminist activists Ã¢Â€Â” created, got taken over by much more conservative, socially acceptable, heterosexual organizations. It was just so relentless. Pretty depressing. ANDERSON: Yeah, and then it became the service industry and the social change movement. ALLISON: Exactly. And there was this constant struggle about whether it was radical or whether it was reform. ANDERSON: Right. ALLISON: Some of that is coded Ã¢Â€Â” I always thought Ã¢Â€Â” was a coded argument, because the real argument is Ã¢Â€Â” (chuckles) Ã¢Â€Â” the real argument was, who was career making and who was trying to change the world? And, you know, both can happen at the same time. A lot of these organizations became conservative because people were career making and they couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t risk their careers, so they had to keep their respectability quotient. So they couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t do real radical stuff. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s like, right back to the waitress union. You know, theyÃ¢Â€Â™ll let you do a whole lot of things that look radical, but when you actually begin to deal with genuine economic issues, theyÃ¢Â€Â™ll shut you right down. Or youÃ¢Â€Â™ll suddenly be in danger in ways you havenÃ¢Â€Â™t been before, which is some of what happened in the rape crisis and shelter movement in D.C. At the same time, there was a rape crisis center that survived in D.C., that was radical and that fought tooth and nail for that funding, and actually got a lot of it, and I worked with them for a while too. Reference 9 - 0.14% CoverageAt a certain point, it just became obvious to me that the women I was falling in love with Ã¢Â€Â” one of them was going to kill me, and that I had to do something about it, but I couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t figure out anything.

There were, like, six of us. And all of a sudden, everything I have done for 20 years has been redefined in their terms, and the terms were very clear. I was a shill for the pornographers, I was a pornographer. Everything that I had ever written about sexual deviance and incest was suddenly redefined as a pornographic, monstrous text. When I was really trying to sort stuff out about incest and sex and family, it was just horrific, and I had to start fighting to say, Ã¢Â€ÂœNo, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s not what IÃ¢Â€Â™m doing.Reference 11 - 0.23% CoverageTheory is all very well and good, but I want to know how people are staying alive on the street.

If I were still alive, IÃ¢Â€Â™d be living in a trailer park in Greenville, South Carolina, with a bunch of kids, some of whom would be dead. Because thatÃ¢Â€Â™s what I was raised to be. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not about good or evil or justice. That is what I was supposed to do, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s what would have happened. But because I was a baby dyke, I was not going to be pregnant at 15.

Also, because of going home and talking to my family and finding so much strength in that, I went back into doing a lot of focus on working-class issues, and talking about class issues, which IÃ¢Â€Â™d always talked about and always written about, but thereÃ¢Â€Â™s ways in which, curiously enough, in the feminist movement, itÃ¢Â€Â™s a big issue, itÃ¢Â€Â™s a primary issue, but it disappears out of the narrative steadily, and you constantly have to be calling attention to it. Even with New York Women Against Rape, we did a number of teach-ins and conferences where we were trying to talk about how it affects your organizing Ã¢Â€Â” rape and shelter work and antiviolence work Ã¢Â€Â” about talking about class issues. Reference 14 - 0.81% CoverageBut then, later on, because we were still feminists and still fighting feminist issues, I got kicked out because they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t approve of some of my feminist activism.

How would you monitor that? ALLISON: Oh goodness. One is that Ã¢Â€Â” My ideology, my conviction, is to honor all perversion, which means, you know, the girls that want to come and just watch get just as much respect as the ones who want to put on a show. A lot of people who go to parties Ã¢Â€Â” itÃ¢Â€Â™s about exhibitionism and honoring that, but trying to make it so that no one was being harassed or forced to do stuff they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to do. That gets very complicated. And to a certain extent, youÃ¢Â€Â™ve got to know the people and know whatÃ¢Â€Â™s going on. It can pretty easily step over into being Ã¢Â€Â” what is it? Ã¢Â€Â” matronizing. (laughs) Ã¢Â€ÂœI donÃ¢Â€Â™t know that she really wants to be tied up in that way, Jean. YouÃ¢Â€Â™re just talking her into doing this because there are all these people watching and youÃ¢Â€Â™re showing off, and she looks decidedly uncomfortable in a way she doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t enjoy.Ã¢Â€Âù You know, having to be that person is a pain in the ass. ANDERSON: That was your job? ALLISON: That was one of my jobs. ANDERSON: To monitor that. ALLISON: We had different people who did it. We had dungeon masters or party monitors who would act that way. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s really profoundly complicated to have a feminist sex party. (laughs) Some of it is simple. You make sure thereÃ¢Â€Â™s food, you watch the consumption of liquor. You make sure there are no drugs, because then you get busted. You make sure there are no people underage, because then you get busted.

I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think that I was non-monogamous as a feminist choice. I think I was non-monogamous because I was an incest survivor and I was afraid of intimacy.

So then a lot of that became a lot of my erotic charge for most of my teenage years.

You always feel that thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a burden of guilt on you, somehow you did it. You were responsible. It was your fault. At any rate Ã¢Â€Â“ ANDERSON: Did you get help from any adult at that time?

ItÃ¢Â€Â™s always there. We have to look at what our families went through in that colonization process. We have to look at what our mothers and our fathers went through, what our grandparents went through, what our great-grandparents went through Ã¢Â€Â” and prior to that, before a reservation, all the wars, all the violence, and the famine and the relocation. You know, we have to look at all of those things and how that impacts our community and our lives today. In boarding schools, there was a horrendous amount of corporal punishment that took place, as well as sexual abuse. Our mothers, our fathers, were raped, were sodomized, were violated by the priests within the Catholic Church. And prior to contact with boarding school experience, sexual abuse was unheard of on children. It was unheard of in our culture Ã¢Â€Â” not to say that it did not exist, but from all the questions and research that we have done and all the interviews, that on the very rare occasion when something like that would surface, it was dealt with harshly. Abandonment, you know Ã¢Â€Â” you were abandoned by the tribe. You were set outside the camp to survive on your own and thatÃ¢Â€Â™s it. You were disappeared. It was dealt with very harshly. The impact and the volume of sexual assault that occurred and sexual abuse that occurred in the boarding schools, you know, the rapes and the molestations, have had a horrendous impact on our culture. And the appropriate resources have not been provided for us to deal with it appropriately by the Indian Health Service or Health and Human Services. So, what weÃ¢Â€Â™re doing is, weÃ¢Â€Â™re, in our communities, starting the healing process, the dialogue, because of the impact, generation after generation, that this has had on our people. And itÃ¢Â€Â™s very important to start that process of dialogue, to start the process of ceremony, to start the process of healing and to engage in that, because Indian Health Service, for the magnitude of the problem, is virtually doing nothing. And that, to me, is a continuation by omission, by omitting their responsibility, of the colonization process and the genocide and the ethnocide. And so, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re very guilty of that.<Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Avery_Byllye> - § 13 references coded  [3.41% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.31% CoverageROSS: Because Faye Williams, Linda Leaks, and Ajowa Ifateyo had come to Washington from Gainesville, I believe it was, where they had learned cervical exams.

This is the meeting weÃ¢Â€Â™ve been waiting on. So we began organizing in D.C. to get the bus from D.C. down there. But actually, we came in a van, but it was because of that FloridaÃ¢Â€Â“D.C. connection that introduced the black feminist community in D.C. to cervical exams.References 2-3 - 0.63% Coverage And so, at that conference, Lillie got to introduce her workshop. And I remember we were going to have it in a classroom and the place was packed, and they tried to close the door and people were taking the door off the hinges. So next, Lillie moved it up to the big area, outside area, in the big hallway, in the walk path. So it was huge. And it was really there that I think we really started to understand that we are the ones we were waiting for, like June Jordan said, and that the answers are in our stories, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s in the process of telling our stories that can set us free and put us on the right path. So it was such a gift, and it was such a wonderful way to learn about our health issues, to learn about how much violence that we were living with Ã¢Â€Â” be it domestic violence, be it sexual violence Ã¢Â€Â” to know that so many women have been raped, that so many women have been victims of sexual abuse, and have had no way to talk about it, to heal, and how when women do it in isolation or when itÃ¢Â€Â™s done to us in isolation, we think that weÃ¢Â€Â™re the only people having it happen, that nobody else in the world is having it happen. But what we learn in the presence of other black women, that this is happening, we understand that we have an institution of sexism thatÃ¢Â€Â™s going on in our lives that tends to oppress us, and that the only way we can get out from under it is to learn how to unhook. And that was the gift that Lillie brought to the black womenÃ¢Â€Â™s health movement, is how do we unhook, and the value of storytelling.References 4-5 - 0.76% Coverage In 1985, we all went to Africa.

But then the conference on top of that was just incredible Ã¢Â€Â” and to have it in Kenya and to have those African women with their congas made special for the conference and to have all the hundreds of workshops and the daily newspapers. And a film was made of us called ItÃ¢Â€Â™s Up to Us that was made by a woman from Connecticut, Bea Milwe. She followed us around and we found this womenÃ¢Â€Â™s group out in the rural part of Nairobi and they raised cows and we went and spent a whole day with them Ã¢Â€Â” dancing, learning about their lives, us telling them about our lives, and learning how different our lives were. And then, not a whole lot that was very similar, that they really lived very different lives from what we had. It made a lot of us a lot more appreciative of our lives. And then, in a lot of ways, they had things that were a lot better than what we had Ã¢Â€Â” that we introduced the word incest to them, that they had no word for it. But we were trying to explain incest to them. And explain rape, which they had kind of vaguely heard of rape happening in Nairobi, but certainly not where they were. And then for incest, they had to do a translation. There was no one word for it. And I sort of was sorry we introduced the term. But then, on the other hand, there was such a reality in our lives to leave there without having them understand that, I think, wouldÃ¢Â€Â™ve been not being our true, authentic selves. We also collected money and we bought two cows for them and left them with two cows, which was really, really good. I think about those women sometimes and wonder how much has changed, you know, in these years between their lives and our lives.References 6-7 - 0.31% Coverage But what was so wonderful, one of the women, Mankubo Manelepe(?), lived in Lenenye(?), in the Northern Transvaal of South Africa, and she was a smart woman.

We taught them Self-Help, we talked about our issues, we focused in three areas. These were the areas that were identified by the women in South Africa, and each of us Ã¢Â€Â” there were five of us Ã¢Â€Â” and each of us were paired with a South African woman. But the areas they identified were domestic violence, sex abuse, and HIV/AIDS. Those were the three areas they identified that they wanted to talk about. I think it was HIV/AIDS.

We connected, and she was very influential in helping me think about reproductive health Ã¢Â€Â” helping me work through things about rape, about abortion, about a lot of the hard issues and things that I really had never talked to anyone about.

And I can say to you that it helped me to realize that African people could be anything that we wanted to be. It led me to feel very close solidarity with African people, wherever we are, and it resulted in me getting involved in the pan-Africanist movement, something that was very vital to me. Thinking about Ã¢Â€Â” and almost having this Ã¢Â€Â” IÃ¢Â€Â™m a very concrete thinker, and so, I almost had this vision in my head of pieces of a puzzle coming back together, as African people from all around the world would pull back together again, with the different strengths and weaknesses that we have based upon the different places of the diaspora where we were sprinkled Ã¢Â€Â” or raped and robbed or whatever. And pan-Africanism became very important to me.Reference 12 - 0.54% Coverage I think that, though, one thing that I must say that stands out crystal clear to me was probably the most important thing I did was ask the question, WhatÃ¢Â€Â™s the difference between black womenÃ¢Â€Â™s health issues and white womenÃ¢Â€Â™s health issues? Mostly because that placed an emphasis on looking at us based on our ethnicity, our culture, our subculture, the way we were reared, the things that go on in our life and how that affects our health, and the fact that we as black women have a different perspective. I was really perplexed by, when white women got together, really the most of the things they only wanted to talk about were reproductive health issues. But when black women got together, and we started talking about health, we started talking about different things. We started talking about things that had to do with psychological well-being. We started talking about issues that were affecting our lives Ã¢Â€Â” violence, sexual abuse Ã¢Â€Â” and also, white women were talking about these things, but they were not priorities. And reproductive health Ã¢Â€Â” black women would use reproductive health services but they were not priorities. And so, the whole thing that makes our health issues unique to us depends on looking at what are our specific priorities that have been influenced by who we are and our ethnicities.Reference 13 - 0.21% CoverageThat it is important to learn about the life of the grand midwives in the South, and how they took care of women who had babies, how they helped women who had had far too many babies and didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to have other babies, how they handled women who had been victims of rape, how they handled women who were victims of incest. How they worked with everything in a nonjudgmental way, that, I think it is really, um Ã¢Â€Â” thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a lesson in there for all of us. So, I think, do your homework.

And more than anything else, I think that if black people are suffering today from the rulings of Clarence Thomas Ã¢Â€Â” and they are Ã¢Â€Â” a lot of it has to do with their refusal to take up Anita HillÃ¢Â€Â™s exposure of him as a sexual abuser. And had they taken that a little bit more seriously, they would recognize that black faces in high places is not something thatÃ¢Â€Â™s going to resolve the problems that black women are facing today, nor that other people of color are facing today.

So here I am as a lesbian working most of the time on abortion which, of course, can be a lesbian issue because you can be raped and whatever, but itÃ¢Â€Â™s not a big high on most lesbiansÃ¢Â€Â™ agendas. So that when the split came later, when the lesbians were all thrown out of WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Liberation, it really hurt a lot because we had been so part of the movement and we had not pushed a separate lesbian agenda ever. You know, we had done what was the consensus work of that WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Liberation movement. So one of the things we did that I remember quite well was that we decided to sit in at the office of the secretary of HEW, Health, Education and Welfare, which was the precursor of HHS, Health and Human Services that we have now, and again, I think we brought kids to that, too, actually, because nothing disrupts an office like children. And, you know, we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have our demands for childcare entirely in place but there was no childcare. And we also wanted people to see that we werenÃ¢Â€Â™t against children, we were just against, you know, the lack of choice. I have a picture of this somewhere, you know, in the secretaryÃ¢Â€Â™s office. This was a sit-in. This was totally civil disobedience.<Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Diallo_Dazon_Dixon> - § 2 references coded  [1.37% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.76% Coverage Going back to positive women, there are folks like Denise Stokes, who was diagnosed with AIDS at like the age of sixteen, and became an activist by the time she was seventeen. And is still an activist up to now, leading the way for other young, newly diagnosed HIV-positive women to branch into other areas of the reproductive justice world. Folks like Patricia Nalls at Ã¢Â€Â” who has inspired me of late, because when I say Ã¢Â€Âœof late,Ã¢Â€Âù itÃ¢Â€Â™s because Ã¢Â€Â” The epidemic itself is 27, almost 28 years old. However, the leadership roles that HIV-positive women and women diagnosed with AIDS have taken on have come much later in the epidemic. So now you do have folks like Patricia Nalls who continue to inspire me, in the sense that Ã¢Â€Â” just like women who were survivors of rape are the women who started the first rape crisis centers in this country. Or women who are survivors of cancer are the women who have started the major cancer movements in this country, and so forth. And that we now have a movement of women living with AIDS who are in leadership in the movement Ã¢Â€Â” are some of the most inspiring voices that keep me in this work.Reference 2 - 0.61% CoverageSo you've got the violence against women, you've got the HIV situation, and then you combine that with this third leg around an untouched area of mental health needs that we have. I would include substance abuse in that, but the mental health status, meaning how healthy we already are in our belief system. How we feel. How stable are we? How much trauma are we already surviving as women based on some of the other social injustices that happen to us? Rape, incest, child molestation, just neglect, being treated differently because of skin color in the family. I mean, all of these are critical issues for women of color that play into not only the decisions we make in terms of HIV but what might happen or us or what might not be available to us because of all of those other conditions. Those are the intersections where HIV and reproductive justice and human rights really come alive in the work that we do at SisterLove.<Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Frantz_Marge> - § 1 reference coded  [0.09% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.09% Coverage I made my firstsoapbox speech about the Scottsboro Case, which was a major cause cÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨bre of that period, starting in 1931.

And saying, well, in economic development, it's these foundations. In women and AIDS, it's these foundations, and individuals. In violence, it's actually just two individuals who provide. One woman who is anonymous put nearly seven million dollars in donor [advised] funds at the Ms. Foundation in the area of ending violence against women. And with a particular focus, some of the money on childhood sexual abuse. Because she was the victim of childhood sexual abuse herself.

You know, sometimes around the dinner table, things can get kind of harsh, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t like that in my family. It was really Ã¢Â€Â” it was good. At the same time, you know, a lot of my adult work in recent years has been about preventing child sexual abuse, so I went through that whole period of time in my teenage years from the age of 12 to 16, when my father, you know, sexually abused me. So that was a tortuous period for me. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t talk about it and, personally, for me, those years Ã¢Â€Â” I had a very happy exterior which I tried to maintain as best I could and I had a tortuous interiorlife. The split between those two things Ã¢Â€Â” there will always be some kind of pulling together that I have to do around that. IÃ¢Â€Â™m sure weÃ¢Â€Â™ll talk probably a little bit more about [the abuse], but the overall family life in which my siblings and I were embedded, in the environment my parents worked to create, was a good family life. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s part of what has made me care about prevention, and to want to do whatever we can to pay attention to prevention so that these kinds of families arenÃ¢Â€Â™t torn apart by a sexual abuse thing happening, which is what would happen in todayÃ¢Â€Â™s world if that happened to me and IÃ¢Â€Â™d told about it. Reference 3 - 0.40% CoverageYouÃ¢Â€Â™re supposed to do it the right way. You know, it was more of that, just sort of where do you get the positive feedback is when you do it the right way. So maybe I have a little more perfectionist in me than I prefer because thatÃ¢Â€Â™s a little bit hardwired. But other than that, well, I guess thatÃ¢Â€Â™s a strong enough enforcement when youÃ¢Â€Â™re a kid Ã¢Â€Â” being encouraged. In a way, as I got to be a teenager more Ã¢Â€Â” aside from all the child sexual abuse, which is a story in itself Ã¢Â€Â” I could see that some parents of my friends didnÃ¢Â€Â™t seem to care much about what their kids did, and I began to value the fact that my parents cared about what we did. They paid attention to it. So, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s sort of a mitigating factor, too, because it was good to have your parents care about what you did and pay attention to what you did.Reference 4 - 0.35% CoverageHENRY: Um, not that I recall. But, um, I just Ã¢Â€Â” I was looking through my papers and I saw that I had published a poem about child sexual abuse back then and I want to look at when that was published, because I thought it was published when I was in Washington and if it was, then I Ã¢Â€Â” I donÃ¢Â€Â™t believe we addressed rape. WEIGAND: Actually, I said race. HENRY: Oh, race. IÃ¢Â€Â™m sorry. WEIGAND: ItÃ¢Â€Â™s OK. HENRY: IÃ¢Â€Â™m sorry. WEIGAND: Rape is another interesting question. HENRY: Well, yeah, I was just trying to remember, you know, when we started dealing with that issue, and I think it was within National WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Commission. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think we dealt with race at all at the Massachusetts GovernorÃ¢Â€Â™s Commission.Reference 5 - 0.51% CoverageHENRY: Well, there were quite a few, actually. What was not divisive was everything right in the middle: equal education, equal pay, childcare Ã¢Â€Â”you know, basic civil rights. Those Ã¢Â€Â” everybody was for them, but around those issues were issues that were emerging issues. How do you deal with the issue of rape? Is child abuse a feminist issue? And there were commissioners Ã¢Â€Â” Catherine East, in fact Ã¢Â€Â” who argued against including child abuse in our national plan of action. And I made a very strong statement. One of the earliest pieces of activism I did was to work behind the scenes with Gloria Steinem to get child abuse on the agenda. I couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t, in those days, use child sexual abuse because I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t able to be public about what had happened to me, but thatÃ¢Â€Â™s why I did it. We put it under the whole rubric of child abuse, and Gloria made a wonderful argument, you know, that child abuse affects girls disproportionately Ã¢Â€Â” involves women. You know, we need to have child abuse as part of this national plan of action, and she was successful in arguing for that. Reference 6 - 0.16% CoverageHENRY: I did. And Bella was a complicated person for me personally because I Ã¢Â€Â” I found myself, in the middle of the IWY process, having quite a number of dreams about Bella Abzug setting up circumstances that I would get raped in.

In fact, finally, I was cut off from my parents. I mean, my parents disowned me. You know, I always think, you know, you see these things on Oprah and all these kind of talk show places where they tell the happy-ending stories of incest survivors talking about it and their family reconciling. I wrote a review of Dorothy AllisonÃ¢Â€Â™s Bastard Out of Carolina where I was not explicit about the incest in my family, but I said that I came from a family where incest was a part of that history, and that one of the things that was never talked about is what that did to women, between women. Not just between a woman and a man, or women and men, but women and women, because you never believed a woman would have your back if you were a, you know, a victim of incest, and you werenÃ¢Â€Â™t defended by the women in your family. And somebody, I suspect in the anti-porn movement, send that Ã¢Â€ÂœWomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Review of BooksÃ¢Â€Âù review to my family, and um, I got a letter from my father that said, you are no longer our daughter, and we disown you, and that was it. And they never spoke to me again. ANDERSON: So, you werenÃ¢Â€Â™tÃ¢Â€Â”you and your mom werenÃ¢Â€Â™t talking about these very personal issues of violence and sex in your home when you were both active in a movementÃ¢Â€Â?. HOLLIBAUGH: No. Or, we were very occasionally. My motherÃ¢Â€Â” so that was kind of the ending. But we had times when we were close and not close. My mother never believed me around the incest, and never, I think, could never afford to hear me. Because it wouldÃ¢Â€Â™ve changed in a fundamental way, her relationship to my father. However that wouldÃ¢Â€Â™ve worked out, she wouldÃ¢Â€Â™ve had to be willing to risk it in order to believe me. I told her when I was eleven; she didnÃ¢Â€Â™t believe me then. I told her again when I was twenty, she didnÃ¢Â€Â™t believe me then, and I, you know, blah, blah, blah. But around violenceÃ¢Â€Â” my mother once said to me that the only thing she ever regretted about my childhood, of how she raised me as a kid, was that she, was so out of, so physically out of control. And that it was the one thing she felt like she really would change, if she ever could do anything differently again. That she knew she hit me a lot, she knew she really was wacky, in the way that she was out of control herself and that she really was sorry for it. So it was clearÃ¢Â€Â” and that was the end of that conversation, I mean, we never pursued beyond that. References 4-5 - 0.55% Coverage The one person that I have been close to all my life and that my mother was close to all her life was her older sister, my aunt. And the one thing that my motherÃ¢Â€Â” my mother was forcing everybody to cut away from me. She tried to do that to my aunt, to say to my aunt that she couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t ever talk to me again, but my aunt really rebelled and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœI donÃ¢Â€Â™t have to tell you about it, but IÃ¢Â€Â™m not going to cut Amber out. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s your choice, IÃ¢Â€Â™m not going to do itÃ¢Â€Âù. So my mother knew that Mary and I were still connected. And my mother would kind of tell Mary things that Mary would then tell me, it would kind of be thirdÃ¢Â€Â” it would be an odd route. And my father actually called and left me a message saying he would be willing to go into family counseling. My father, I think actuallyÃ¢Â€Â” I mean, my father knew what he had done, and my father, I think, was willing to look at it. But my mother was not. And I think that was because my mother would have been to blame, too. That she had not protected me and she had not defended me and she had not, she had not challenged my father. She had not done those kind of things. Which is a real differenceÃ¢Â€Â” if you look at Bastard Out of Carolina at least DorothyÃ¢Â€Â™s mom didnÃ¢Â€Â™t think she was a liar. She didnÃ¢Â€Â™t leave the guy, but she didnÃ¢Â€Â™t think she was a liar. She tried to do what she could to protect her even though she was staying. My mother did not. My mother did something that I think is actually much more classic, which is that you claim the kidÃ¢Â€Â™s wrong, and then you connect and kind of identify with the other adult, and you form a unit against the kidÃ¢Â€Â™s exposure. And thatÃ¢Â€Â™s basically what my mom did. And my dad, I think, when this all exploded, was willing to really look at it. I think heÃ¢Â€Â” he and I had had many confrontations about this, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not as though I hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t said it directly to him. But as long as my mother couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t tolerate this as a conversation in the family, there was no movement that he and I could do, really. And so it, really, it stayed at a moment where there was conversation, and then, they moved. And they cut everybody off and all of that. And I just decided, you know what? The truth about incest is it already gives people who perpetuate it way more time in your life than they ever had the right to. Way more power in your life than it ever had the right to, and I, you knowÃ¢Â€Â? ANDERSON: You just decided to be done with it. References 6-7 - 0.42% Coverage You know, if, if they lived their lives, basically embedded in that bitterness, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s their lives. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not mine. I feel like, incest is a profoundly horrifying set of experiences, over time. Not just in terms of what it does to you when itÃ¢Â€Â™s going on. It has enormous impact over the course of your life. And the only thing you control as an adult coming to terms with it, is how it will, how it will intersect with the way that you understand yourself and the way that you live your own life. You cannot guarantee that you will come to terms with it in, in relation to the perpetuator or the other parent, your siblings, any of those kinds of things. None of those things are the markers that you control. The only thing that youÃ¢Â€Â” as a feministÃ¢Â€Â”really have, is the tool of understanding, trying to actually understand why something happened, and how youÃ¢Â€Â™ll live with that history. What it will or will not do to you, the choices it does or doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t influence, the way that youÃ¢Â€Â™ll be yourself as an adult around a child. All of those are in your control. Beyond that, none of the rest of it is open to a singular understanding. And, so for me, I feel like, you know, I saw it rip our family apart over time. It ultimately meant that we could not stay united as a family because it couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be resolved. I think thatÃ¢Â€Â™s quite classic. I think in fact, all those stories that arenÃ¢Â€Â™t the happy ending stories, very often end like that. With people never speaking again, people never seeing each other again. People never together agreeing on the nature of that history. And that you have to live with that. Because that, because thatÃ¢Â€Â™s not what you control. ANDERSON: Where did you find the tools? I mean, what is also classic is that the little girl grows up to perpetuate, or to, you know, all sorts of outcomes thatÃ¢Â€Â? HOLLIBAUGH: Or be a victim of people who perpetuate.References 8-9 - 0.35% CoverageHOLLIBAUGH: I actually think it was all of those things. I mean I came through a movement, meaning the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, that gave me the right to have that history without being ashamed. Because you do have terrible shame, I think, connected to it, and you do think that you participated in it. In fact, I actually think you do participate in it. This is a part of the feminist movement that, that I think we often havenÃ¢Â€Â™t talked about enough, that in fact thereÃ¢Â€Â™s oftenÃ¢Â€Â” whether you desired incest or not, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s parts of desire that play into the sexuality that happens. My fatherÃ¢Â€Â™s hands were some of the, were the most beautiful menÃ¢Â€Â™s hands IÃ¢Â€Â™d ever seen. I know I desired his hands. Did I desire him to rape me? No, I did not. But there was a way that he has always been a sexual figure to me. Was that true when I was seven? Yeah. Was it true when I was eleven? Yeah. And so, you know, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t like to leave myself out of my own history. Things didnÃ¢Â€Â™t just happen to me as though I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have my own complex relationship to it. But feminism and the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement gave me a context to speak about and explore my own interior world and my own damaged history. And that is an extraordinary gift and I think actually the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement has given that to women, even though itÃ¢Â€Â™s now kind of pop culture instead of politics, it still is a very different world to be, to be incested and to try and recover from incest than it was thirty years ago, or fifty years ago, like when my mother was trying to deal with all the stuff that she had gone through.References 10-11 - 0.36% Coverage And in complicated stories, I think you generate a very different kind of coming to terms. IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to kind of bring it back around again, because I think, I think finally all the political movements that have a moral underbelly often position us in similar ways without having the possibility of complicated relationships to our own oppression and our own power. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s why itÃ¢Â€Â™s so difficult to be white and deal with racism, and why people want to beÃ¢Â€Â” why theyÃ¢Â€Â™re so defensive in that conversation if theyÃ¢Â€Â™re white, why itÃ¢Â€Â™s so hard to talk about sexism and talk about power relationships. Because thereÃ¢Â€Â™s never a way to really allow your messy history to not be cleaned up, and to not finally decide that you were right and they were wrong, you had no power and they had all of it. Rather than to look at the real framework of how you had very few choices in a world that never saw you, and you did the best you could. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s how I look at my parents. Even with all the bad things that happened. They were not bad people. They did the very best they could. They had limited tools and limited understanding. They brought the best of themselves, they tried as best they could, this is what they could do. I got what they had. They used what they had. And when they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have it anymore, they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t use it. And the job was for me to try and figure out how to survive my own history, and then make different choices. Not blame them for not having good choices. And I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think you come to terms with things like incest unless you can forgive people who have acted on you in ways that you never deserved.References 12-13 - 0.43% Coverage But there was a real, a real understanding that things left unseen, and unstated, and untold, the secrets of grief, shape history. And that if people could come forward and say what had happened to them, and confront the people who had hurt them, speak directly to them, it was a differentÃ¢Â€Â” that was reconciliation. Not because those people could ever compensate them, but because they could face the people who had hurt them, and say that it was unjust. And IÃ¢Â€Â™ve always thought that political movements should spend more time thinking about frameworks that actually allowed us to both confront and reconcile grief with oppression. Especially in terms of class, in terms of things like sexism and violence, because the men that perpetuate, or the women that perpetuate either of those things, but mostly men, are also men you love. And so if we could find a way in our own movements, to both hold people accountable and still love them, I think we would build a different kind of movement, that could confront real powerlessness and real oppression differently, because we would not say to people that they had to choose not to love those people any longer in order to hold them to a standard of behavior that they did not match. And, you know, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not a conversation we talk about. And yet, when I look at things like violence and incest and substance abuse and all of that kind of stuff, reconciliation and truth are precisely what you actually need to do, in order to be able to live with. How oppression turns you into an animal! I mean, give me a fucking break! Being poor, being hungry, being addicted, being violated yourself, being disrespected and hated, doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t turn you into a nice person. And if weÃ¢Â€Â™re ever going to, in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, come to terms with the way that we are hurt, and we hurt each other, it will be because we can actually have a different kind of dialogue that doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t assume that IÃ¢Â€Â™ll sue you or IÃ¢Â€Â™ll imprison you. References 14-15 - 0.38% CoverageEven though, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think my mother thought of leaving except at one point, early on, when she got in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, and I really think she did think of leaving, for awhile, for like, six months, then closed up that possibility. My dad, I think, always thought of leaving, but didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have the guts. So he was constantly, as I was growing up, talking to me about other women, and you know, asked me at one point how IÃ¢Â€Â™d feel if he married my auntÃ¢Â€Â” who he had dated before he married my mother. You know, incest stuff is like, very weird, in poor white trash Ã¢Â€Â” ANDERSON: Where does that come from, for him? I mean, does that come from his family, the incest? Do you know? HOLLIBAUGH: Well, he, heÃ¢Â€Â” it is not, this is not what I know, so again. This was not, this was opaque in my family, but Ã¢Â€Â” it was very clear that my dad was attracted to his mother, and his mother was attracted to him. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s also clear that Gypsy began to teach my father about sex when he was about fiveÃ¢Â€Â”brought women in for him, and maybe participated, itÃ¢Â€Â™s never been quite clear to me what her role was, but clearly there was real stuff that went on between them, which then when my father married my mother really became a problem, because the sexuality wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t just on GypÃ¢Â€Â™s part, it was my dad, too. I mean, clearly there was a sexual current between them that was intense, and that my mother found appalling. And didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to participate in, and didnÃ¢Â€Â™t approve of. And my dad then, was himself, somehow compromised I think, in his own sexuality when he was young, by his mother. Um, so, it much, very much fits the pattern. And he was pretty much sexually out of control all his life.Reference 16 - 0.23% CoverageItÃ¢Â€Â™s kind of disgusting butÃ¢Â€Â” and when I got in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement the first period where I think my mother was really thinking of leaving my dad for the first time I was in a commune, and one nightÃ¢Â€Â” you know, we were all sleeping in a million different rooms, and you know, it was like, those daysÃ¢Â€Â” and I heard this woman in the room next to me having sex with somebody, and it sounded to me like my dad, and I got up the next morning, and it was! In my commune! And so that was one of the first times that I had a confrontation with my father about incest. And said to him, Ã¢Â€ÂœI know what you fucking have done, and I know what youÃ¢Â€Â™re doing now, and mom doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t know it, and this is like, unacceptable, and if you want me to expose you, I willÃ¢Â€Â” If you donÃ¢Â€Â™t stop this affair, IÃ¢Â€Â™m likeÃ¢Â€Â” because this woman that youÃ¢Â€Â™re sleeping with is in mom and myÃ¢Â€Â™s CR group, so mom is like, in her fucking CR group, this woman whoÃ¢Â€Â™s fucking you, this is like, unacceptable, sheÃ¢Â€Â™s twenty, momÃ¢Â€Â™s fifty.References 17-18 - 0.18% CoverageHOLLIBAUGH: That was for my parentÃ¢Â€Â™s benefit. And in that failing, as my life unraveled there, I also was in terrible conflict with my mother. I had told her about the incest and she had not supported me. I had started dating men that were much older, kind of in response to that. I wasÃ¢Â€Â”and I was out a lot. I was out with girlfriends and boyfriends, I was fucking around, I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t exactly having a lot of sex yet, but you wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have known that. I became a Ã¢Â€Âœbad girl.Ã¢Â€Âù And that actually had never been true for me. I had been poor white trash or mixed race in the schools, and often considered other and not someone you wanted to be a friend with or take home, but I had been a straight-A student, I had been a Ã¢Â€Âœgood girlÃÂ€Âù in that sense. In high school, as I began to fail, I really came undone.Reference 19 - 0.19% CoverageHOLLIBAUGH: I think, the part of it that I think, just kind of to re-frame it, IÃ¢Â€Â” at the point where the incest stuff was really, where I told my mother what was going on and she refused to believe me and believed my fatherÃ¢Â€Â” ANDERSON: But that happened a number of years, rightÃ¢Â€Â” youÃ¢Â€Â™re talking at what age, here? HOLLIBAUGH: Eleven or twelve. Um, and if you look at the pictures in my book you can clearly see a shift in how old I lookÃ¢Â€Â” and it clearly happened, that was really, really, really a big crisisÃ¢Â€Â” and there wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t, you know, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s nothing you can do about itÃ¢Â€Â” your parents believe you or they donÃ¢Â€Â™t believe you. But itÃ¢Â€Â™s one of the more, itÃ¢Â€Â™s one of the most isolating and kind of terrifyingÃ¢Â€Â” because itÃ¢Â€Â™s terrifying to bring it up and then itÃ¢Â€Â™s terrifying to not be believed.References 20-21 - 0.59% Coverage But in rural areas, a lot of dating is also driving in cars to isolated places and trying to figure out if youÃ¢Â€Â™re going to have to fuck. So I started smoking because it was clear to me that in a bad circumstance, you could always light up, that was completely permissible, and when you were smoking a cigarette, it was very hard for a guy to come on to you, but you could also use it s a threat. You could keep a person distanced from you by how you held it, blowing the smoke, I mean, it was just a tool. And, my entire family smoked like, smoked like chimneys, and so, it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t like I hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t started smoking already trying it out, but I remember pretty consistently at twelve, starting to smoke, a lot. And that it was completely tied to dating and to fear about sexuality. Because I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t actuallyÃ¢Â€Â” I loved being sexually provocative, but I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t particularly want to date. I mean, I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to fuck. ANDERSON: Had you hit puberty at this point? HOLLIBAUGH: Yeah, IÃ¢Â€Â™d hit puberty. And, but, I didnÃ¢Â€Â™tÃ¢Â€Â” you know, when incest is yourÃ¢Â€Â” that doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t tell you anything about sex, it just tells you about violation. So, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not as though you know more, although youÃ¢Â€Â™re not completely naÃƒÂ¯ve and you know, unaware of where a penis goes, but it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t really make a lot of sense to you. So, I started dating this guy. We didnÃ¢Â€Â™t actually have sex, although we messed around a lot. Um, but he was really a protection, against my father. He was one of my fatherÃ¢Â€Â™s friends. My father and he raced motorcycles together every Saturday; he was around all the time. He was somebody IÃ¢Â€Â™d known since I was four or five. My mother wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t too wild that I was twelve and he was 30 or 32 or something, she wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t like, thrilled on that front. But I think actually they were both, they knew IÃ¢Â€Â™d do it anyway. I mean, that was really the bottom line. But the other thing is, I think because theyÃ¢Â€Â” I donÃ¢Â€Â™tÃ¢Â€Â™ knowÃ¢Â€Â” in working class life, age is not the same thing. I know twelve seems young, and I get that itÃ¢Â€Â™s young, but my mother was married at fourteen. You know, so the assumption about how old you are and how you date, it just doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t correlate in the same way.

IÃ¢Â€Â™d felt endlessly betrayed by women. I had been betrayed by my mother. You know, I mean, one of the things that I think never gets talked about in incest is Ã¢Â€Â” not what the impact of incest is on you in relation to men as a woman, but what your relationship to other women is because women donÃ¢Â€Â™t defend you when youÃ¢Â€Â™re facing it as a girl-child. It is your mother tat Ã¢Â€Â” or your aunt or your cousin, girl-cousin Ã¢Â€Â” that have to step in because itÃ¢Â€Â™s not probably going to be a guy. And if women donÃ¢Â€Â™t defend each other, then what does that mean about betrayal? Reference 24 - 0.24% Coverage Well now, this really Ã¢Â€Â” I mean I actually, as a womenÃ¢Â€Â™s liberationist, I actually, you know, IÃ¢Â€Â™ve written about it.

Because I Ã¢Â€Â” the accusations and implications that surround you as a fem is that the reason you like masculinity is because youÃ¢Â€Â™re actually straight. And that the reason youÃ¢Â€Â™re not straight is because you donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to deal with men or you had Ã¢Â€Â” youÃ¢Â€Â™ve had a horrible experience with men, youÃ¢Â€Â™re an incest survivor [laugh]. Your father didnÃ¢Â€Â™t treat you well. Oh, God. And so, you know, youÃ¢Â€Â™re trying to work it out by being with butch women. And I was really horrified that it looked to me like my desire for women and my particular kind of desire for butch women meant that I was betraying feminism. That I was betraying what I said I believed about power and powerlessness, about no roles about Ã¢Â€Â” I mean, those things that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve tried to actually write about in resistance flooded me in the beginning and really Ã¢Â€Â” I was really horrified at myself.Reference 25 - 0.28% CoverageAnd I think sex exploded in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement as kind of the Ã¢Â€Â” I think sex was used Ã¢Â€Â” the explosion around sex, I think, in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement was the cover for class. Because I think it was, in talking about sex, you had to talk about lived experience, you had to talk about background and history. It couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be theoretical. It couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be only theoretical. And, I think that conversation made the divide between people from different kinds of histories and backgrounds very clear. And so a profound fight then broke out about sex that was embedded in the kind of direction feminism had gone in but it also, I think, was profoundly impacted by the way that class and desire ran under those conversations in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement. Of what pornography was and who read it. Of pedophilia and the kind of the assumptions of, you know, pedophilia being about scuzzy men who were poor and slimy. I mean, those were all class assumptions, you know? Pedophilia was never about Harvard professors and, you know, blah-blah-blah-blah. And so, the assumptions then about class and sex, I think, really were embedded in the way feminism reacted to the challenge that different parts of the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement were facing, both from class and from race.Reference 26 - 0.20% CoverageWell, in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, people would feel unbelievably confident to come up and say really unbelievable things to me about my sexuality.

Because it as huge. It wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t just about pornography. It was in every dimension about feminism and about what feminism would represent and how it would represent women and womenÃ¢Â€Â™s oppression and kind of what happened to women and what we would say we understood about womenÃ¢Â€Â™s lives and experiences. So, to me, the fight around pornography and around violence against women and all of those kind of things was Ã¢Â€Â” and where it had resulted, where it had ended by, kind of being siphoned into these identity-based movements, kind of violence Ã¢Â€Â” domestic violence, any pornography, rape crisis, blah-blah, you know, itÃ¢Â€Â™s like, God, did I never mean this to happen. Reference 28 - 0.79% CoverageHOLLIBAUGH: Nope. ANDERSON: -really disconnected from the politics that? HOLLIBAUGH: Well, hereÃ¢Â€Â™s what I felt like Ã¢Â€Â” I mean, I had not started talking about incest until 1980 or Ã¢Â€Â™81 when I met Dorothy. I had quietly said to friends and lovers what had happened to me or some version of that although pretty cautously. But again, in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement when I would try to talk about my experience of incest, the class stuff was so sickening that I then ended up having to defend my father or my cousins or my uncle and say, or my mother, I Ã¢Â€Â” so, when Dorothy and I met, and CherrÃƒÂ?ie was doing antiviolence work then, she was in New York and she was doing domestic violence work, IÃ¢Â€Â™m sure. And that was her job. And so Dorothy and CherrÃƒÂ?e and I would spend a lot of time talking about it. But DorothyÃ¢Â€Â™s who I first told the truth to, because DorothyÃ¢Â€Â™s life around that and my life around that were really quite similar although in different places, but equal Ã¢Â€Â” not equally but in all the ways that people donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to deal with the meaning of it, they were violent and transgressive and relentless and all of that stuff. And so it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t shameful to talk to her about my own history and so I could finally think about it and talk about it and we started doing a little bit of work around it with CherrÃƒÂ?e. We realized the class stuff was so bad that we couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t figure out how to talk about without it instantly kind of sinking into a class discussion that we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have any tools for and that there was no markers around. So, people would Ã¢Â€Â” felt completely free to comment on what they thought of your family. And I think parallel to that at the same time was the Ã¢Â€Â” I donÃ¢Â€Â™t even know how to say this, but the accelerating aspect of feminism that made your victim status the most relevant totality of your experience, that you never had a relationship to your own oppression, that you never had a complicated relationship to what was done to you, that you never participated in it in any way. In order to try to say that women had not been asking for rape or incest, we went to a place that was really dangerous. (cough) Do we need to stop? Anyway, the tragedy of the attempt to reclaim womenÃ¢Â€Â™s lives by making us victims so that we could assign responsibility where we thought we had been powerless, and so we could reclaim womenÃ¢Â€Â™s right to, you know, claim that they were raped even though they were married, or incested even though they had been provocative little girls, you know, all of that kind of stuff, I think, had a terrible ultimate impact on where feminism ended up. Kind of making its arguments for what happened to women and what you had to think about. And that became an impossible place for me. I mean, I just felt like, you know, it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t make it OK to say what my father did to me. IÃ¢Â€Â™m not saying itÃ¢Â€Â™s OK that my father raped me by also saying that I was attracted to his hands, but I donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to leave one piece of it out in order to also talk about the other. And in incest stuff, for me, I found it really difficult precisely because my father was the person that I was the closest to in my family, and the violation was extraordinarily twisted precisely because IÃ¢Â€Â™m most like him and he most held out for me in my family and so what happens Ã¢Â€Â” what betrayal looks like when it also is connected to the very best that you Ã¢Â€Â” that somebody brought to you of love and hope is not either you were a victim and they were a monster or you deserved it and they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t know what they were doingReference 29 - 0.51% CoverageSo again, I feel that feminism has played an essential role in the work that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve done and what itÃ¢Â€Â™s allowed me to do, but itÃ¢Â€Â™s also limited its own possibility of generating what I think it intrinsically could have done because of who it was afraid of allowing to enter its centrality of voice. If feminism as well as lesbian feminism is fundamentally a narrative of womenÃ¢Â€Â™s stories that collectively generate ideology and theory and practice, then if [at] that center is absent women of color, working-class and poor women, women with an extraordinarily different set of sexual histories and class histories, then you donÃ¢Â€Â™t Ã¢Â€Â” you donÃ¢Â€Â™t have at the center the majority of womenÃ¢Â€Â™s lives. And thatÃ¢Â€Â™s what feminism is missing, is the majority of women never joined that movement. And they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t join it because feminism was wrong, but because feminism had a bias in it about class and race. And by implication, then, about sex and homophobia. And itÃ¢Â€Â™s a tragedy to me that though there were many women like myself in that movement, including in places of relative power Ã¢Â€Â” you know, I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t a powerless foot soldier through that whole story, we were always marginal outsiders invited in, and then left out. Barbara Smith tells basically the same narrative. Cherrie tells the same narrative. Dorothy tells the same, Jewel tells the same. Because we were always both endlessly desired and profoundly worrisome voices to the way that the stories were being constructed and the way that the ideology flowed from the personal is political. Well, what personal? If poverty is as essential to the way you understand violation as incest, then a very different story gets told. If incarceration and racism is as fundamental to the identity that you have as a lesbian woman as any other piece of it, if youÃ¢Â€Â™re constantly having to pick, you know, Pat Parker really did say, you know, Ã¢Â€ÂœSome day I want to go to a party and bring my entire self.Ã¢Â€Âù And nobody did ever say it better than that. And the movement never allowed the totality of identities to merge in the way that the movement created its agenda and understood the world that it was functioning in. And therefore, it really limped, even though it was so powerful, even in spite of it, that it still had resonance for huge numbers of women.<Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Kramer_Marian> - § 1 reference coded  [0.28% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.28% CoverageWe had Annie Chambers, oh my God, Annie Chambers.

We had organized the first women of color conference on violence against women of color ever. And itÃ¢Â€Â™s interesting because there was one that happened in Santa Cruz like a few years ago, and they all said it was the first. IÃ¢Â€Â™m going, 1983, we did it, you know. ANDERSON: Now thereÃ¢Â€Â™s INCITE. I mean, talk about being on the cutting edge of whatÃ¢Â€Â™s coming up. MORAGA: Right. I mean, we did that in 1983 with these great sisters from D.C., black women who had this rape crisis center in D.C. It was a national conference It was like Native women who were doing battered work up in Minneapolis showed up. We had the Asian sisters meeting in Chinatown. It was also the idea that people needed to meet autonomously and then come together. So black women were in Harlem, you know. We, Latinas met in the Lower East Side. And itÃ¢Â€Â™s like everybody had a spot. Then we all came together. IÃ¢Â€Â™d yet to see that kind of organizing going on. So the whole notion of autonomous women of color organizing was just starting. And one of the reasons I started to work at the Rape Crisis Center is I felt like I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have enough non-cultural organizing experience of just doing grassroots organizing, basic organizing. I felt like I had always been dealing sort of with culture, you know, which is a form of work, but I wanted to really see what my worth was in terms of just being able to really, to run an organization or to actualize an organization and how women of color operated in it.Reference 2 - 0.71% CoverageMORAGA: Well, I always have.

And myself, Sandra Camacho, and another friend Ã¢Â€Â” well, she was a girlfriend of mine at the time, Vienna Carroll, an African American woman who worked in reproductive rights, the three of us were all working for this.

And we had this women of color caucus, and we basically wanted Ã¢Â€Â” after we did the national conference, we thought, Now we can just do it! We donÃ¢Â€Â™t need these white women. We can just do this. You know, because there was a lot of problems, a lot of problems about how you work culturally specifically around rape working with middle class white women, particularly around sexuality, and you know, issues of sexual violence, and so we were all ready to go. And basically the women of color caucus voted to stay with the white women, right? And I felt completely betrayed, you know. I was young, so you have this Ã¢Â€Â” you know, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s nothing like when youÃ¢Â€Â™re young because you just believe you can do it, you can do it all, you know. And I was shocked. And I remember speaking to them and trying to explain to them what a mistake it was, what they were doing was such a mistake, that we were operating out of fear, that we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t need them, that we could do it.

So the Defense Committee hired the Jury Project, which was growing out of the whole Attica struggle. Now the women in my CR group were working on the Attica case, and they were part of doing this Jury Project of showing they couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t get a fair jury trial. You know what IÃ¢Â€Â™m talking about?

And they were looking for people to do that survey work. Barbara got a job working with them, with my friend Beth Bonora, who was in the CR group. So she went down to North Carolina. She called me from down there. She said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhere are the feminists?

As we are led into perpetual war for the Ã¢Â€Âœgreat American empireÃ¢Â€Âù it will continue to be more and more women and children murdered, raped, sold into sexual slavery, and abandoned here at home (as in Katrina victims who still donÃ¢Â€Â™t have homes.) Sometimes I think I just want to ship everything off to you and just go and stand in front of the White House like my old suffragist models. It was only after the war was declared that they were attacked so violently, beaten, arrested, etc<Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Nussbaum_Karen> - § 1 reference coded  [0.27% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.27% CoverageWe were really about employment issues for lower-wage women. And we did not confront directly the more cultural issues about men in your life and whether there were social services around issues. Those were very important issues for women that hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t been acknowledged before, whether it was rape or violence in the home or whatever. But, it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t our focus.<Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Payne_Ladoris> - § 4 references coded  [2.34% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.90% CoveragePAYNE: In 1982, I started to feel better. I know exactly when it was. In 1982, I started to feel better Ã¢Â€Â” November of Ã¢Â€Â™82. I woke up in Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, and it was like there had been static in my brain, and I sometimes think Ã¢Â€Â” I donÃ¢Â€Â™t talk about this too much anymore Ã¢Â€Â” I sometimes think that I had the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s worst case of PMS, because I was sick all the time from it. And it was before there was a lot of, you know Ã¢Â€Â” like everything happened before there was a lot of focus on it. And between not knowing what to tell the doctor Ã¢Â€Â” and nobody ever connected diseased ovaries and other things with what might be happening to me mentally and psychologically. And certainly nobody talked very much in the Ã¢Â€Â™50s and Ã¢Â€Â™60s about self-esteem and, you know, womenÃ¢Â€Â™s issues. There was very little focus on the particular role that black women had in the civil rights movement. There was just not sensitivity to the things that could cause illness. And because I was an intelligent person, I really served as a guinea pig for doctors. I was going to Washington UniversityÃ¢Â€Â™s mental health clinic. And I canÃ¢Â€Â™t remember how many times they had me as the focus for discussion for interns. Because I could articulate what I was feeling, you know, I really think I served as a guinea pig and that they tried different medications. One doctor, after a long time, even suggested that I smoke marijuana instead of taking the medications, because, well, they were giving folks LSD, marijuana, everything, man. But a young, intelligent, undereducated, underemployed, physically and sexually abused, unmarried woman with a small child living in poverty Ã¢Â€Â” youÃ¢Â€Â™d have been crazy as hell not to be depressed. (laughs) Me. And nobody ever looked at any of those things. They just said, WeÃ¢Â€Â™ll have to increase that medicine. Nobody ever talked to me about diet, exercise, anything that I could do except take medication, you know. And it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t just me. There were lots and lots of people lost in the medical system that just Ã¢Â€Â” nobody ever talked to me about food supplements, you know, nothing. Nothing, nothing. Just take the medication. Just take the medication. And when I see what I saw over the years was, I saw so many women, not just get sick, but die. And I had lupus. And not just get sick, but die. I buried my friends Ã¢Â€Â” from strokes, from heart attacks, from lupus, from high blood pressure, you know. It wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t just about people being sick. The people died Ã¢Â€Â” from battering, from domestic violence, from drug abuse, from poor decisions, you know. People died. People died. The women died. And we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t know what was killing us. And we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have any place to talk together. Church wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t helpful, because at church, they talk to you, you donÃ¢Â€Â™t get to talk, you know. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s helpful because you learn some stuff, I guess, if you go or whatever, but the people didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have an opportunity to express themselves. So, in our circles, I think because I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t ashamed of what had happened to me, I could talk about things like being sexually molested, being a victim of domestic violence, without feeling that it had been my fault. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t think it was my fault. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t think it was my fault. I know whose fault it was, but I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t think it was my fault. And I think, because I began speaking about these things, women started to come to me, individually and in small groups, and they wanted to talk about what happened to them, too. So, the beginning of this work is what we used to call Community Conversations, where we would just have something to eat, a cup of tea, a cup of coffee, and just talk about what was going on and what did it mean.References 3-4 - 0.43% CoveragePAYNE: Oh, yeah, started to read the AA stuff. And I just started to reprogram my thinking. One of the things that I stopped doing, deliberately, was I stopped blaming myself, but I also stopped blaming others. And I think I began to understand that everybodyÃ¢Â€Â™s life has a series of challenges, and some are more difficult than others, but it is your response to the challenge, not the challenge itself, that determines the quality of your life. And I began to teach that, to not be a victim. Not be a victim. Not be a victim. To rise up, you know. And it was revolutionary for me, but also for a lot of the women that I work with, because a lot of the women thought that because these things had happened to them, therefore they were always going to be a victim of domestic violence, sexual abuse Ã¢Â€Â” that their primary identity was around that victim status.<Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Pharr_Suzanne> - § 8 references coded  [2.30% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.12% Coverage It was also in that time when we all began doing hotlines, not just for women to call in to talk about general things, but particularly for violence. And then there was anti-rape work that came out of that. There were tremendous fun things. References 3-4 - 0.05% CoverageWe covered political issues, you know, issues of violence, issues of rape, those kinds of things.References 5-6 - 1.18% Coverage But what was startling in it was this enormous number of women being murdered. And we were able to analyze it and say how many were murdered. We didnÃ¢Â€Â™t even do rape and incest and all the other acts of violence Ã¢Â€Â” though in racial violence and religious violence and homophobic violence, we did verbal violence as well as physical violence as well as murders, so that we could talk about the climate of violence in the state. But with women we were able to analyze Ã¢Â€Â” we started this in Ã¢Â€Â™87 or Ã¢Â€Â™88, I think Ã¢Â€Â” and we were able to analyze whether they were in relationship with the person who killed them, whether there was any sexual act involved, whether there was any acts of violence against their body, like drawing things on it, cutting things on it, that kind of thing. We were able to analyze all of those pieces. And so we kept these horrible logs, wonderful and horrible, with these huge numbers of women who were killed. And weÃ¢Â€Â™ve had them now 18 years. And saying that we were using them for all kinds of things. One of the things we used Ã¢Â€Â” but let me finish that sentence. We would use them for all kinds of things, but, if nothing else, that we would be witness during this period of history. We would be there to say, This is the racial climate in the state. This is the climate of homophobia. This is the climate of religious oppression, and this is the climate of murder of women. And though we may never change anything, people will know that as many women were killed each year in Arkansas as were killed in Vietnam at the height of the war. And who is speaking out and who is crying about this? We also used it to say sexist violence should be considered a hate crime. We were among the first to say that. And what made it so powerful was we would say, What is it about this thatÃ¢Â€Â™s not the same as acts against people of color or acts against religious minorities? So we did a lot of national work, taking that local evidence. Then we did a lot of just consciousness-raising, and we still do that. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s kind of gotten [to be] a popular thing now, but we would put tombstones out on our front lawn with a bio of the woman Ã¢Â€Â” this was around 1990 Ã¢Â€Â” and call press, and the families would come and lay flowers next to them and you would see the picture of this woman and read this heartbreaking story of why and how she was killed, and often, what didnÃ¢Â€Â™t happen to the perpetrator. References 7-8 - 0.96% CoverageWe would take on really, really hard issues. An example would be at the University of Arkansas, it had a great winning basketball season. They were heading to a tournament. And the basketball players, who happened, that year, to be African American, took home to the dorm a young Ã¢Â€Â” I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know how young, maybe college-age Ã¢Â€Â” white woman, who was very drunk and dancing on the tables and that sort of thing, and all raped her. And it was a huge, huge thing in the press because it was going to take them out of the tournament. That was what the primary press was about it. We jumped in the middle of that. And it was fierce. It was really fierce. We thought that this was what our job was, that we had to jump in the middle of that and talk about both race and gender. ANDERSON: So did you have differences of opinion with other feminist organizations and leadership? PHARR: The feminists were furious with us, and the African American community was furious with us, and the sports community was furious with us. Eventually I think people came to understand what we were talking about. But we did a gender analysis about rape, and we did a racial analysis about sports and African Americans and the use of African Americans and tossing them away, out of the school. We put those two things together. We gained someone here. We would lose someone there, but gosh, we were attacked in the newspaper. We received hate mail, all kinds of things. But we thought that this was our work. The work was not to lay back and say, Well yeah, you know, she was drinking. She deserved to be raped. Well yeah, you know, these African American men, it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t matter that they were poor young men in southeast Arkansas who were recruited to play basketball and are not given an education while theyÃ¢Â€Â™re there, and the second they have an injury are tossed out and back in poverty. WeÃ¢Â€Â™re not going to talk about race and class, weÃ¢Â€Â™re going to talk about all of that. So that was our work. <Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Ports_Suki> - § 4 references coded  [3.16% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.32% CoverageAnd I think I clearly see that when I wanted to send my children to the school IÃ¢Â€Â™d gone to, and my husband and I believed in public education, and I went down to the local school, I saw that it was not going to be possible for me to send our children to that school. So I would either have to do something about it, or find a private school for them to go to. I think the saddest day was when I felt I had to take my children out of public school, and that was because a seven-year-old little girl was raped at the lunch hour, and she came into the school office and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœA man was playing with my pussy.Ã¢Â€Âù And she had blood streaming down her legs, and she was crying. And the school principal, who was a woman of color, told her to sit down on the bench, went into the office, shut the door, and talked to the Board of Education legal department to see what her legal liability was in the case of this child. Nobody hugged that child. Nobody cleaned that child up. Nobody called that childÃ¢Â€Â™s mother. Nobody called the police. They left that child for one hour sitting on the bench crying, and letting the blood keep down her legs. It was not until the next morning, when I had brought my children to school, and my husband was home sick, and I was standing in front of the school chitchatting with a few of the other parents. Somebody Ã¢Â€Â” who I promised I would never divulge who it was, somebody said to me, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou donÃ¢Â€Â™t know what happened in the school yesterday, but youÃ¢Â€Â™d better find out quick. Let me tell you, a child was raped,Ã¢Â€Âù and proceeded to tell me, and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœYouÃ¢Â€Â™d better do something about it because nothing is being done about it in the school.Ã¢Â€Âù So I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, what are you doing about it?Ã¢Â€Âù Well, of course he kept walking down the street when I said that. So I talked to the parents, and I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWeÃ¢Â€Â™ve got to do something. This is what happened.Ã¢Â€Âù And everybody was outraged. But I realized what this little girl must have gone through. Nobody hugged her and said, That man was wrong; you didnÃ¢Â€Â™t do anything wrong. This school principal convinced the mother to take her out of the school. And I realized how young women are not treated in a respectful way for what their feelings are or what happens. Now this was only one case, but as we were standing out there talking, a car came cruising along, and it was the local community relations policeman, and he was this wonderful Irish guy. He got out of his car, and he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, Suki, what are you doing standing out here?Ã¢Â€Âù I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou know damn well what IÃ¢Â€Â™m doing out here. IÃ¢Â€Â™m telling the other parents what IÃ¢Â€Â™ve just heard about wha was going on in the school yesterday.Ã¢Â€Âù So he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, you heard?Ã¢Â€Âù I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœYes, I heard.Ã¢Â€Âù He said, Ã¢Â€ÂœThat bitch!Ã¢Â€Âù And I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœExcuse me?Ã¢Â€Âù He said, Ã¢Â€ÂœShe could have called us. The kid gave such a description of that man, we could have picked him up in no time because the kid gave such a good description of what the man looked like and what the man had on and what he smelled like.Ã¢Â€Âù He said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWeÃ¢Â€Â™re furious.Ã¢Â€Âù I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœIf youÃ¢Â€Â™re so mad, would you, please Ã¢Â€Â” youÃ¢Â€Â™re in plain clothes Ã¢Â€Â” would you please go walking around the school and see who stops you, and check all the doors, see if theyÃ¢Â€Â™re all locked.Ã¢Â€Âù So he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, you know, they have to be able to open them from the inside out.Ã¢Â€Âù I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœYeah, but I want to know if theyÃ¢Â€Â™re locked from the outside so the guy canÃ¢Â€Â™t get in. He got in somehow.Ã¢Â€Âù So he went around, and he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœNobody stopped me. Half the people donÃ¢Â€Â™t know who I am. Some of the people know who I am.Ã¢Â€Âù Some of the administration knew him, but the average teacher didnÃ¢Â€Â™t know him. He said, Ã¢Â€ÂœNobody stopped me.Ã¢Â€Âù Now this was the day after a very serious issue. So the parents Ã¢Â€Â” we got together, and we said, Well, weÃ¢Â€Â™re going to have to stop everybody from going in the school. We discussed, What are we going to do? Finally we decided, Okay, weÃ¢Â€Â™re going to have armbands on all the teachers, and weÃ¢Â€Â™re going to tell the children they may not talk to anybody who doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t have an armband on. And if somebody doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t have an armband on, they should tell their teacher they saw somebody and give a description. And nobody can come in the building unless they agree to have an armband put on. Well, you know, youÃ¢Â€Â™d think this would be a perfectly reasonable solution. There were teachers who refused to put an armband on. Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™m not going to wear something like that.Ã¢Â€Âù Well now, if it had been their child that was raped, wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t they want to do something? We couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t think of anything to do without disrupting the educational program, but we thought this would be perfectly simple. Teach the kids somebody was hurt in the school and not everybody in the school should be in the school. So I learned about the stereotypes of Ã¢Â€Â” A teacher doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t necessarily care about the children sheÃ¢Â€Â™s teaching; a teacher doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t necessarily care about the issue. And so we ended up having to go to court because a few teachers pushed, shoved, accused us of pushing, shoving Ã¢Â€Â” you know, got into a thing. Well, eventually the hearing officer, the judge, chastised the teachers for not doing what they should have been doing, and thanked us as parents for taking an interest. And that even annoyed me, because I thought, Why do you have a stereotype that parents wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have an interest in their children? But there are so many ingrown concerns that people have about other people and how they act or donÃ¢Â€Â™t act. And so we ended up closing the street, we ended up doing all kinds of things to have demonstrations, and finally they agreed to having somebody on patrol. Now, this isnÃ¢Â€Â™t now, where you have guns being looked at or security things going on with the children. This was a little seven-year-old girl, and nobody protected her and nobody said, WeÃ¢Â€Â™re sorry. And she was whisked away, and she was sent to another school.References 3-4 - 0.84% CoverageSo just like finally America has gotten to the point where a lot of things are translated into Spanish. It is not the same in Asian culture. So the health departments not only have called us other and donÃ¢Â€Â™t call us Asian and Pacific Islander Ã¢Â€Â” Native Americans and Asians have been put together as a group called other, so a lot of data is put as other and we donÃ¢Â€Â™t Ã¢Â€Â” you canÃ¢Â€Â™t write a proposal and say, Our data is based on other. So we have the problem of people not understanding that specific AIDS education has to be in the specific language, but that also the customs are very critical. And you have to respect not only the traditions and customs, but you have to respect what has happened, for example, during the war Ã¢Â€Â” and I say the war meaning World War II, but it could be Vietnam, it could be, you know, what went on in Korea. In a war situation, just like Abu Ghraib and different things that have happened with American soldiers terrorizing and raping and doing things that soldiers feel they have a right to do when theyÃ¢Â€Â™re in another country. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s a man thinking that he has the right to rape a woman of another language. That happened in World War II. In the case of World War II, very often it was the Japanese soldiers going to China or the Philippines, and so you have people there who hate the Japanese, rightfully so, because of what they perceive to be such a dehumanizing situation. Those same people Ã¢Â€Â” if, for example, I spoke Japanese or spoke English with a Japanese accent, and I went into a group and tried to give them AIDS 101, they would be thinking to themselves, What is that Japanese woman Ã¢Â€Â” look what the Japanese did during World War II. What is she talking to us about sex for? The lesson would be lost. They would be reliving World War II. And itÃ¢Â€Â™s just like, IÃ¢Â€Â™m sure, some Iraqis will be reliving whatÃ¢Â€Â™s going on now. And even though we deny that things happen, we deny that we Ã¢Â€Â” we do do things during war, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s a man-woman thing, itÃ¢Â€Â™s a conqueror mentality. There are a lot of different theories of what it actually represents, but we have come a long way for Asians to finally have some voice, but itÃ¢Â€Â™s very limited<Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Pratt_Minnie_Bruce> - § 12 references coded  [1.41% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.44% Coverage I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know exactly how old I was, but Martin Luther King was leading the struggles in Montgomery at the time, and the FBI Ã¢Â€Â” and see, I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t know this but I know now Ã¢Â€Â” the FBI had started its disinformation campaign against him. So there was all this literature floating around out there defaming him in one way or another, right? I remember my father calling me into the living room. He was sitting in his rocking chair, and he had some of this literature. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s the only time my father ever talked about sex to me. And what he did is he told me that Dr. King had been molesting young girls, and this proved it, right? And I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know what else he said, you know, whatever, this is why these people are terrible. This is, you know, whatever his line was. I just remember that part of it very distinctly, and I remember feeling that something was terribly, terribly, terribly wrong that my father would be talking to me like this about sexual matters Ã¢Â€Â” that something was really, really wrong, that he would be doing that, that it was across all appropriate boundaries, that it was just Ã¢Â€Â” wow, this is bad, bad, bad.

And I knew that the reason Cris was raped was because she was a butch lesbian. I knew all this stuff, but I hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t put it in a larger context of the history of lesbians and butches and the bars and the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement.

They were representing Daughters of Bilitis. I and I forget who else showed up representing Gay Liberation Front. And there were people from the other organizations. And this one guy, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember what his organization was. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember his name, even, but he apparently had been raised really Catholic. He was antiabortion. The Gay Liberation Front put out a platform in which we had these resolutions that we wanted the conference to pass, and one of them was abortion rights, end to the Vietnam War, right to ingest the drugs of your choice, right to have sex with whoever you wanted, an adult, right to adult consensual sex. Nobody would have put in right to have sex with children at that point. So we had a whole platform. Antiracism. And this guy got up and he spoke about how terrible abortion is.

[laughs] But the essence of that platform was, besides the antiwar stuff, was the right to control your own body. <Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Smith_Barbara> - § 9 references coded  [1.30% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.14% CoverageROSS: Well, IÃ¢Â€Â™d like you, first of all, to believe that you can share what youÃ¢Â€Â™re comfortable in sharing.

Joanne Little wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t in Boston. We had a kind of a relationship to the Edelin struggle. But these were both very important things that were going on. Joanne Little was a prisoner in North Carolina, as I remember. And one of the jail guards came into her cell with the intent of raping her. She, I thinkÃ¢Â€Â”did she stab him? ROSS: I think she got his gun and shot him. SMITH: Right, to defend herself, and then she ran away. She actually was able to escape. And I think she was found and, of course, again, she was being prosecuted for murder. And what the people who were supporting her and who were defending her were trying to get to is that, when someoneÃ¢Â€Â™s trying to rape you, you are in fear of your life and you actually have the right of self-defense. And that was exactly what the case was about. And one of the things that they needed to prove was, was he really trying to rape her? Well, there was clinical forensic evidence that showed that Indeed thatÃ¢Â€Â™s exactly what his intention was. And it was interesting again to see in my papers, how they got to that reality before DNA testing and all of that. I believe, of course, that she was exonerated as well. But her name and her face and the case were a rallying cry for progressive feminists all around the country, but particularly for progressive feminists of color, because we absolutely understood that what had happened to her happens to black women and poor women and women of color in a particular way.References 4-5 - 0.34% CoverageAnd then a few years later when a man named Willie Saunders was accused of raping two women in Brighton, which was a virtually all-white section of Boston at that time. As I said, Boston was extremely segregated, just like Cleveland was extremely segregated. Segregation was the law of the land. And hey, is your town segregated today, you know? Has it ended? It really hasnÃ¢Â€Â™t ended. But in any event, Willie Saunders was doing some painting work in Brighton. Two white women were raped and he got accused. And we had to stand on principle once we had been informed of the details, you know, of his defense, we were asked if we would be supportive around his defense because the perception amongst progressive women and men and people of color and white people in BostonÃ¢Â€Â™s political community during that period was that he was being railroaded in the great tradition of railroading black men for supposedly sexually violent crimes against white women.References 6-7 - 0.17% Coverage What we meant at that time, and you have to understand it in its historical contextÃ¢Â€Â”this is a time when black politics were being defined almost solely from a male perspective. [interruption] So to say, IÃ¢Â€Â™m concerned about rape, IÃ¢Â€Â™m concerned about child care, IÃ¢Â€Â™m concerned about violence against women, IÃ¢Â€Â™m concerned about sterilization abuse, IÃ¢Â€Â™m concerned about quality education, you knowÃ¢Â€Â”that wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t on a black agenda at that time.References 8-9 - 0.06% CoverageSo you know, we could be against apartheid at the very same time we could be against rape and battery.

So she organized women to go in a group, and that was what allowed her to win.Reference 2 - 0.50% CoverageSTEINEM: That came about (laughs) in a typically atypical way, which was that the publisher who had published the first book, Outrageous Acts, had access to unpublished photographs of Marilyn Monroe, and asked me if I would write text to go with them. It happened that we also owed that publisher a lot of money, because we had used my book as a subscription premium and then not had the money to fully pay for those copies. So in order to pay the debt, and also because, like many women, I think, I had always had a kind of rescue fantasy about Marilyn Monroe, in the sense that, had there been a womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, would she still be alive? So many things about her were like exaggerated versions of many womenÃ¢Â€Â™s experiences: being sexually abused as a child; being abandoned by her mom Ã¢Â€Â” a single mom; abandoned first by her father; and certainly being treated as an object more than a person in many ways, especially before she became famous, but even afterward. So if she had felt less alone in those experiences, would she have been able to survive? So I was also fascinated, but if it hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t been for paying the debt and the photographs, I probably wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have done it. I would have contented myself with a brief essay that I did for Ms. magazine about herReferences 3-4 - 0.23% Coverage For instance, I read writing about Marilyn Monroe by Norman Mailer, who disbelieved her childhood abuse. Why? Because her first husband, whom she married when she was very young Ã¢Â€Â” I think 16 or 17 Ã¢Â€Â” said that she was a virgin, so she couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have been sexually abused when she was a child. This, first of all, believes the husband. Secondly, doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t know anything about the nature of childhood sexual abuse, which is often oral; you know, the kids are too little. It just was so unthinking and so disregarding of her own words that it made me angry on her behalf. <Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Thom_Mary> - § 4 references coded  [0.78% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.51% CoverageWhen I think back on it, we would go out at all hours and part of what weÃ¢Â€Â™d do is raise money, weÃ¢Â€Â™d stand on corners and raise money for SNCC.

I remember fighting off, almost getting raped several times. I mean it was completely ridiculous, what we were doing, but we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t know any better and actually no dreadful thing happened, so I was propositioned by the guy I worked for. I had to quit that job. It was the sort of typical experience that women had, and probably still do. References 3-4 - 0.28% Coverage There were women who spent their life organizing against rape or against battery, and thatÃ¢Â€Â™s very interesting, how those movements Ã¢Â€Â” like in the United States, there was early feminist organizing around the issue of rape, but domestic violence took much longer, whereas in England, it was completely the opposite, and IÃ¢Â€Â™m not sure [why]. <Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Toure_Nkenge> - § 43 references coded  [15.40% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.26% CoverageMy sexual formative experiences were not all that great, because I was raped, and when I was raped I was a virgin, so that didnÃ¢Â€Â™t put me off to a great start.

It was like this dude I was going with and he had joined the service and he had been away for his basic training. He came home in his uniform. He was drunk, and I was babysitting, and I let him come in. And I knew that my mother wouldÃ¢Â€Â™ve never approved of me having my boyfriend come over where I was babysitting somewhere.

So, how did you transition from Save the People to doing feminist work? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, you know, we had the bookstore and I had Against Rape, and there was a book prior to Against Rape that was on the topic of rape. And in that area of Northeast, there had been a couple of assaults surrounding the neighborhood where we lived, or where the bookstore was, and weÃ¢Â€Â™d had a couple of meetings where women could come out and talk about it. ROSS: WhoÃ¢Â€Â™s the Ã¢Â€ÂœweÃ¢Â€Âù? TOURÃƒÂ‰: We, meaning myself and a couple of other women were Save the People. ROSS: All black women? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes. ROSS: What year was this? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Seventy-four, late Ã¢Â€Â™73, maybe early Ã¢Â€Â™74. And as a result, I was on the radio one day, on WHUR, doing an interview and talking about rape and sexual assault, and some women at the Rape Crisis Center were listening to WHUR. Now that in itself is an intriguing mystery. ROSS: Why were these white women at the Rape Crisis Center listening to this black radio station at Howard University called WHUR? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes, it must have been because Michelle was there. So, anyway, yeah, because Michelle said she heard it, so they had WHUR on and they heard this interview, and they wanted to find Ã¢Â€Â” Oh, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s another black woman in D.C. talking about rape. We must find her. And I got a call from, I believe it was Deb Freidman at the bookstore, and asking me Ã¢Â€Â” introducing herself, she was from the Rape Crisis Center, and asking if I would meet and talk with them about Ã¢Â€Â” and I went and I admit, I was curious. I mean, the Rape Crisis Center. I was curious. I went. We talked. I met Michelle. Michelle asked me to go to American University with her and do a presentation. And that, sort of, was the genesis of the relationship with the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. ROSS: So describe to me who Michelle Hudson was. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Michelle Hudson was the community education coordinator. She was black, she was the second Ã¢Â€Â” the Rape Crisis Center started in 1972 and so, we are now up to Ã¢Â€Â™74, so itÃ¢Â€Â™s only been, like, two years. References 7-8 - 0.20% Coverage So that is how Ã¢Â€Â” that is who Michelle was. She was the community education coordinator. She did a lot of the work of creating the first materials that were used for education and her job was to go out in the D.C. public schools and do presentations on rape and prevention, and that is what she did. ROSS: Did she go on to become the director? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No. She did not. Michelle actually left the Rape Crisis Center and she went to My SisterÃ¢Â€Â™s Place and became the director at My SisterÃ¢Â€Â™s Place, which was a shelter for battered women and their children. References 9-10 - 1.86% Coverage I started formally working at the Rape Crisis Center, I believe it was something like October of 1974, because Kianga was born in March of Ã¢Â€Â™75, yeah, so it must have been Ã¢Â€Â” make sure I donÃ¢Â€Â™t have my childÃ¢Â€Â™s dates wrong Ã¢Â€Â” yeah, I think it was October of1974 that I began working at the Rape Crisis Center. And at first, I was just sort of doing all kinds of things, you know, doing a little hotline stuff, a little community education stuff. It wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t all Ã¢Â€Â” and really, I think they were sort of preparing me for NancyÃ¢Â€Â™s job, the general administrator, because she was going to leave, and after she left, I became general administrator. ROSS: OK. What was going on in your thinking about black women and the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement at the time? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh, child, a lot of things. First of all, I mean, I was very passionate about the issue of rape and sexual assault and women being helped. I was very disturbed by what seemed to me to be the lack of a presence of black women and women of color in the movement. But certainly many of our clients were black women. So what was going on in my mind was one, how to serve women and two, how to get more women of color involved in the Rape Crisis Center and get the Rape Crisis Center more connected with the community, beyond what it was. It was also, initially, in the beginning, it was a learning time for me, you know, to learn exactly what is feminism. You know, how do people define feminism? What is the scope of feminism under that definition? Learning more about pornography, because IÃ¢Â€Â™d never really thought about pornography Ã¢Â€Â” you know, nasty men read pornography at night when nobodyÃ¢Â€Â™s looking, or something. I mean, in terms of thinking of it as an industry that disempowered women or, you know, devalued or objectified, all of that. Those were not really words in my vocabulary or concepts, you know. So my first months at the Rape Crisis Center, first year, was a learning process for me, too. Learning more about feminist thinking and what the issues and the politics of it was. And always trying to see how it fit and integrated in my community, because I certainly saw the urge to try to make people split and choose. If youÃ¢Â€Â™re black, you canÃ¢Â€Â™t be a feminist. If youÃ¢Â€Â™re a feminist, youÃ¢Â€Â™re not black. If youÃ¢Â€Â™re for the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s struggle, then you canÃ¢Â€Â™t be for the peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s struggle. If youÃ¢Â€Â™re for the peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s struggle, then how can you isolate out just the women. All that craziness, you know, just trying to navigate my way through it, figure out what the heck was going on. ROSS: Name some of the black feminists who may have influenced your thinking, you may have encountered in the mid-70s. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh. I mean, certainly people who I was reading, that came more toward, I guess Ã¢Â€Â” IÃ¢Â€Â™m trying to think. When did I first read something from bell hooks and something from Audre Lorde? I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think that I knew a lot of black women, because I hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t really Ã¢Â€Â” in the rape crisis movement at that time, hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t really come across, you know, hardly any other black women. I mean, I knew about New York Women Against Rape and so I knew some of them had to be something, somebody had to be black or Puerto Rican or something like that. But I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t really know a whole lot about who the women were. Of course, I mean, I heard of like the star feminists at the time, you know, Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan and, um, Bella Abzug and Flo Kennedy, you know, IÃ¢Â€Â™d heard of, but I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t really know a lot about that. ROSS: So at the time, weÃ¢Â€Â™re talking about Ã¢Â€Â™74, Ã¢Â€Â™75, Ã¢Â€Â™76, what was the Rape Crisis Center doing vis-Ãƒ -vis black women in terms of outreach to or work with or Ã¢Â€Â“ TOURÃƒÂ‰: Talking about it. Even though they always made a concerted effort to bring black women onto the staff, they really felt that going into the schools or education should be a black woman, because thatÃ¢Â€Â™s mainly who was going to be in those schools, that that was in the staff, there should be black women. There was really a problem recruiting. There seemed to be a problem to recruit black people onto the board of directors, you know, who came or who actually stayed. So for the most part, most of the time, for a really long time, the board was always Ã¢Â€Â” basically, it was white, as was, now, in Ã¢Â€Â™76, when we went with CETA and VISTA, you know, and CETA was the concentrated employment program [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act], so that brought us quite a few women of color, and then VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America, that brought us Ã¢Â€Â” so that was the time when we had the largest women-of-color staff. We had Latino women, because we wanted to do work in Addams, which was a predominantly Latino community, to assess the attitudes about rape and what kind of services and what people did there, and the same in the black community. So, we had, like, three or four Latino sisters and about six black women that came on specifically through CETA and VISTA. I think the main way that the Rape Crisis Center at the time was reaching the black community was through the services provided for clients. They were just always aware that they were very lacking and very short in terms of the relationships and the networks et cetera to be a crisis center in the District of Columbia. References 11-12 - 2.29% Coverage TOURÃƒÂ‰: OK. As I recall, there was, in 1970 or Ã¢Â€Â™71, there was this big womenÃ¢Â€Â™s speak-out in New York, where all these women came and they talked about feminism and sexism and chauvinism and all of those kinds of things. And were kind of assessing, I guess, in a way, assessing the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement and identified violence against women as a really big issue, you know, not just ERA, for the equal pay thing, or the right to have an abortion, but violence against women, and out of that, the women who participated in that session, a couple of them came from D.C., and so they decided that they were going to start a rape hotline. ROSS: Do you remember their names? TOURÃƒÂ‰: They started the rape hotline in Jackie McMillenÃ¢Â€Â™s apartment on 17th & Q Street Northwest, here in the District of Columbia, down in Dupont Circle, with this mustard-yellow answering machine. ROSS: Who was the other woman? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Took training. There was Lois Yankowski, Jackie McMillen, Deb Freedman. She came fairly early on, I believe. Val Jones, who worked with the WomenÃ¢Â€Â™s Legal Defense Fund, very instrumental in getting the first My SisterÃ¢Â€Â™s Place started and all of that. It was a group of women like that, trained themselves to be able to work on a hotline and take the calls and they developed a very strong political analysis about rape and its relationship to power. All the things that everyone criticized women for having as part of an analysis of violence against women Ã¢Â€Â” who now, the mainstream themselves, embrace a large part of that ideology or that perspective, that politic, or that analysis, however you want to say it, about that, that they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t do before, Post Traumatic Stress [Disorder], you know, rape trauma syndrome, just any number of things that the women were saying in Ã¢Â€Â™72, Ã¢Â€Â™73, Ã¢Â€Â™74 went on for so long, that the more traditional society, law enforcement, medical, social, was rejecting all of that, have now had to come around and embrace it. And not just embrace it, but kind of like take it over and claim it, like this was their thinking, their theory, all along and all the time, which was just so outrageous, such revisionist history. In that house, in that apartment on Q Street, and it stayed there in JackieÃ¢Â€Â™s apartment for some time. And from JackieÃ¢Â€Â™s apartment, the first place it went was to that small, two-room across the street from Lincoln Junior High School on 16th and Irvin Street. ROSS: OK. There were some feminist magazines, and wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t there a group called the D.C. Area Feminists Alliance? TOURÃƒÂ‰: FAAR. ROSS: Feminist [Alliance] Against Rape. Tell me about FAAR and Ã¢Â€Â“ TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, FAAR was Ã¢Â€Â” some of the women in FAAR were from the Rape Crisis Center who had left the Rape Crisis Center, wanted to do something else or do some things differently, and so there were people who were interested in publishing, and they got interested because there was also a quarterly scholarly magazine called Quest. Quest preceded FAAR, you know, because it was more scholarly, a quarterly and all that. So you had women who worked on Quest who were interested in putting some focus around rape and so forth, and you had women who had been at the Rape Crisis Center who had an interest in putting out written materials and educating in that way, so they got FAAR magazine. The thing IÃ¢Â€Â™m trying to remember, because it had two incarnations, as FAAR and as Aegis magazine. And actually, what I think is that they became FAAR the collective. The magazine was Aegis magazine, and it carried articles and information on sexual assault and theory around sexual assault, you know, all kinds of tips, this, that, the other, different stuff, stories, articles that had to do with empowering women and all of that. Later, Aegis joined with Ã¢Â€Â” oh, yes, and of course, dealing with pornography as well. Later, Aegis joined with domestic violence and half the magazine would deal with issues related to sexual assault, pornography, and the other half would deal with issues dealing with battering and domestic violence. ROSS: Did you get the sense that in the early years, the people at the Rape Crisis Center worked on other forms of violence that women experienced, or was it just gender-based violence? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It was gender-based violence. However, definitely gender based, although the Center did recognize that it was possible for a man to be raped, it was obviously not the primary focus, but there was certainly the acknowledgment that men could be sexually assaulted. You had individuals who worked at the enter who may have had involvement and ties into other movements around other issues, but the Crisis Center was strictly dealing with rape and had its hands full to deal with that, because in Ã¢Â€Â™72 and Ã¢Â€Â™75, I mean, the police, everybody, I mean, it was a battle. You know, if we Ã¢Â€Â” it still continues to be a struggle, you know, but it was a battle. It was a war, you know, in terms of they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want you to have companions. I mean, all rape crisis centers, now you can have a companion with the woman at the hospital thatÃ¢Â€Â™s from the center. So, Oh, no, you couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t do that. They didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want you there because you impeded the investigation by being there. So then it was, like, the only way you could be there was if the woman requested that you be there. I mean, it was all these things, you know. Women asked for it. It was just horrendous. So they werenÃ¢Â€Â™t just dealing Ã¢Â€Â” they were not really making connections to anything else. They were dealing with the dynamics of gender, you know, and as time moves forward, began to Ã¢Â€Â” around different issues, make connections, broaden out Ã¢Â€Â“ ROSS: OK. Now, youÃ¢Â€Â™re saying that your working at the Rape Crisis Center affected your marriage. In what way did your consciousness that you developed at the Center cause you to re-look at your marriage? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t working at the Rape Crisis Center that caused me to Ã¢Â€Â” I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t need Rape Crisis Center. I mean, in all honesty, I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t need the Rape Crisis Center to help me with that at all. When I was saying, working, I meant working in terms of the finances of it. You know, where if the man doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t have a regular job or steady job and you do even just part-time, full-time, whatever it is, the dynamics that that creates. No, it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t a consciousness from the Rape Crisis Center. It was just the consciousness of, you got to go, because somebodyÃ¢Â€Â™s going to get hurt, OK. And so, I ainÃ¢Â€Â™t fit for it to be me, so, and youÃ¢Â€Â™re not leaving my child no place else, so you got to go.References 13-14 - 0.11% Coverage. Because also, two other women, Maureen and BJ, were working on housing at the Center, on the neighborhood stuff around housing, and so from that, they had somehow, they had also gotten into using that as a way for the people to help organize tenants, just safety issues so they donÃ¢Â€Â™t get raped and stuff like that. References 15-16 - 3.61% CoverageÃ¢Â€Â“ about Ã¢Â€Â™78 or so, talking about the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yeah. ROSS: But weÃ¢Â€Â™d met at a housing meeting. TOURÃƒÂ‰: OK. ROSS: IÃ¢Â€Â™m sorry, this is not my story, itÃ¢Â€Â™s yours. TOURÃƒÂ‰: But thatÃ¢Â€Â™s very helpful. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s very, very helpful, because I know it was definitely, it was pre- the Rape Crisis Center, but it was right after the Rape Crisis Center that, when you came to the Rape Crisis Center, right around that time, that you proposed me for the Study Group. ROSS: Right. So itÃ¢Â€Â™s all kind of Ã¢Â€Â” our stories are rather interconnected from then on, but, IÃ¢Â€Â™d be fascinated to hear the pre-1978 story of Nkenge. In terms of, well, you stayed at the Rape Crisis Center for 13 years until 1988. In that time you had a variety of jobs. Tell me about some of the more significant things that you did at the Rape Crisis Center. You certainly pioneered quite a bit. TOURÃƒÂ‰: I did do a lot of things at the Rape Crisis Center, speaking with all humility and truth. Once I came back, I became the director for community education. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s the job that I held. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s the position that I held until I left. I brought Anti-Rape Week into the Rape Crisis Center, something IÃ¢Â€Â™m really proud of, because it exists today under a different name, but Ã¢Â€Â“ ROSS: What was Anti-Rape Week? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Anti-Rape Week was a massive education week where there were all kinds of workshops, seminars, film showings organized, and we advertised and people would come out to events. So it was to build education to raise prevention awareness, and to recruit people into an awareness of, and hopefully support for, the Crisis Center and to take a look at and become advocates for the issue of sexual assault, rape. So we did Anti-Rape Week, and then the women who were a part of FAAR, Feminists Against Pornography, if that was the right name, organized. The Rape Crisis Center had actually worked and organized the first Take Back the Night march in D.C., which I think was in 1978. I think it was in 1978. And then, the following year, I organized Anti-Rape Week. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think we had a march that year. Then the following year is like when Feminists Against Pornography picked up and decided that that was going to be one of their major things that they would do every year was organize a Take Back The Night march and the Crisis Center would work with them, so we coordinated so that the Take Back the Night march became a part of Anti-Rape Week, either the beginning or the end, you know, a major activity. [As a member of Feminists Against Pornography, Marty Langlen, a white woman, was central to this organizing effort. She also became a member of the Rape Crisis Center board of directors. Another woman with Feminists Against Pornography who did a lot of work was Clarisse.] And Anti-Rape Week evolved into Rape Awareness Week, and then as the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault took up rape awareness, and ultimately had Rape Awareness Month, which the rape crisis centers across the country pretty much observed and organized for that in their communities. The hassle-free zone. There was a lot of street harassment going on in D.C. There was a sister named Linda Leaks, not was, she is, who was in school at the time and she was making a film on street harassment, and she was so impassioned about it Ã¢Â€Â“ ROSS: She is a black woman. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Linda Leaks is a black woman who was making a film on sexual harass[ment] Ã¢Â€Â” street harassment, and Linda was so impassioned about it that she also created a t-shirt to stop violence against women, you know, verbal abuse of women. Well, at the time that she was doing that, dealing with the street harassment and kind of strategizing around how to combat it and how to respond to it, white women were also doing some organizing and they had come to the idea that they wanted to make Dupont Circle Ã¢Â€Â” in D.C., Dupont Circle was, is an area that is sort of a hub area for the commercial district downtown and people come there and they eat lunch and walk through, and then, itÃ¢Â€Â™s part of the social life at night. So thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a lot going on in Dupont Circle and around Dupont Circle. So you can get harassed walking through there or sitting in there and trying to eat your lunch, and all of that. So a group of white women had decided they wanted to be able to not be hassled in Dupont Circle, so they wanted that to be, you know Ã¢Â€Â” My idea was that they could not take Dupont Circle and single out Dupont Circle as a place not to be harassed, that if we were going to try to have a campaign, we needed to wage a campaign to make D.C. a hassle-free zone. So that you would have the right, wherever you were, not to be Ã¢Â€ÂœHey, baby, hey, mama,Ã¢Â€Âù all of that kind of nonsense Ã¢Â€Â” Ã¢Â€ÂœWhatÃ¢Â€Â™s your sign? WhatÃ¢Â€Â™s your name?Ã¢Â€Âù Ã¢Â€Â” all of that, that you wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have to deal with it. So, we [joined forces and] entered on a real struggle to make D.C. a hassle-free zone. We met with the police, you know, because we wanted to have penalties. We wanted to have it written in law somewhere, you know, penalties around this whole thing. And we worked on it for about two years, but we just couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t really make it happen. It was too big. But in the process, there was a lot of education. We used to have what were called speak-outs, and weÃ¢Â€Â™d just be different places, at a Metro stop on a Friday, in Dupont Circle on a Wednesday, maybe down at the Federal Triangle on a Monday, Easter Market, various places, to do rallies, where people would speak out about street harassment, sexual harassment on the streets, and we would make the interconnections between street harassment and pornography and rape, you know. And we did a lot of consciousness-raising and a lot of great organizing as a result of that in those two years that we worked on that. Also, doing the organizing of the Take Back the Night marches and the Anti-Rape Weeks that we did for a number of years, that is one of the ways that I was able to bring a lot of women of color into the Rape Crisis Center, that came to work and organize around these different issues for Anti-Rape Week. More women of color than the Rape Crisis Center had ever seen collectively in all the years prior to that. Women came in and it was a very exciting process. They volunteered to be on the hotlines and as a result Ã¢Â€Â” and that was all, that was really good stuff. ROSS: Describe, if you donÃ¢Â€Â™t mind me backing up just a little bit, what was going on that caused the 1980 conference to happen, or am I going too far? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, no. YouÃ¢Â€Â™re speaking about the first conference on Third World Women and Violence. It came about because there was that need to pull women of color together, to acknowledge that violence existed in our communities, to talk about the forms that it took, the kinds of responses that we got to it, the attitudes that existed there, and what needed to be done. It also came about because women of color who were doing this work desperately needed to know each other. We needed to network. We needed to build and consolidate a network. And so, though that conference brought about 80 women, you know, in total, however, they came from a lot of different places, and we were able to find out about, like Fatima Cortez, with that little rape crisis center up there in New Bedford or someplace in Massachusetts. We had the New York Women Against Rape come down, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s when we had the great honor to meet and develop our first relationship with Sandra Comacho, ChrrÃƒÂ?e Moraga, and those women from New York. The women from Boston came, and so we first met Ã¢Â€Â” not Barbara Ã¢Â€Â” IÃ¢Â€Â™m trying to remember Ã¢Â€Â” Barbara Bullette was there. It was the woman who was the therapist, Ruth something [Ruth Hall]. But a few women came from Boston. We all Ã¢Â€Â” that was the start of the building and continuation of a network. Those were the first steps towards that. So that was really, that was really a great, a great conference. And it was really exciting. It was part of Ã¢Â€Â” we made it a part of Anti-Rape Week and it was great, and it was where we got Ã¢Â€Â” I believe itÃ¢Â€Â™s where we got our famous logo. ROSS: Tell me about that logo. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Our famous logo which represented Ã¢Â€Â” the Rape Crisis Center had this beautiful logo that ironically, it was done for us by a brother named Malik Edwards, who used to be one of the artists for the Black Panther Party, who drew the pictures for the Panther Speaks newspaper, and we asked Malik if he would develop Ã¢Â€Â” wait, let me back up for one second. IÃ¢Â€Â™m running two thoughts together. IÃ¢Â€Â™m running this thought Ã¢Â€Â” no, I know what it is. The Shanti Dolls. I was getting ready to run it in with ICAW [International Council of African Women] and the Dolls that Beverly did for us. OK. Put that on the side. Malik, who had been in the Black Panther Party, we asked him if he would develop a logo for us for our conference, the Third World Women and Violence Conference, and he drew for us Ã¢Â€Â” he came back with four fertility dolls, one looking Asian, one African born in America, one First Nation, and one Latina, and it was the details on the fertility dolls that determined the ethnicity of each of them. And so these four together represented women of color, and made an extremely powerful statement. So it became the logo for the Third World Women and Violence conference. And then our very next edition of the Rape Crisis Center publication that dealt with myths and facts about rape, we used that logo on it. And it was just Ã¢Â€Â” what can I say? It was a success. Anyone whoever looked at it loved it. Of course, there did come a time, somewhere down the road, where there was conflict when someone said, Ã¢Â€ÂœThereÃ¢Â€Â™s no white doll, you know, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s only four, there should be five dolls.Ã¢Â€Âù Why? Ã¢Â€ÂœThereÃ¢Â€Â™s no white woman.Ã¢Â€Âù Well, the logo didnÃ¢Â€Â™t change. It didnÃ¢Â€Â™t expand, you know, under the creatorÃ¢Â€Â™s vision. That was his vision of what we had asked him to do for that conference, so that was that. So that is how the Third World Women and Violence Ã¢Â€Â” itÃ¢Â€Â™s called the First National, because it actually was the First National Conference on Third World Women and Violence, and we were honored to be the people to put out the call for that. [Deirdre Wright, who worked at the Rape Crisis Center at the time, was conference coordinator.]References 17-18 - 0.42% CoverageTOURÃƒÂ‰: I left the Rape Crisis Center in August of 1988. To say burnt out is not adequate. It does not begin to describe Ã¢Â€Â” I like to say I was nuked. I was nuked. I just could not Ã¢Â€Â” it had been 13 years, and the last five years of that time had really been Ã¢Â€Â” the last four years of it had really been a lot of battling. A lot of things had changed in the Crisis Center, in the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, in the movement against violence against women. As organizations were striving for the dollars, for the funds, then out came the cry of professionalism. We must be professional. So the whole look and feel of the various centers and shelters began to change. The collective Ã¢Â€Â” the idea of collective running and sharing of responsibilities and those sorts of things, were falling to the side, that seeming need to conform without seeing that at the time, the more we conform, the more we were required to conform, and the more we conformed, the more we were required to conform. And so, you had situations in some places where people who had previously been the executive directors were asked to step down because they were lesbian, they were too radical, they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t fit the image for a professional.References 19-20 - 0.20% Coverage But around Ã¢Â€Â™85 and Ã¢Â€Â™86, the connections begin to be disconnected. Stay in your area, you know, this is rape, you know, this is to provide education for the children, talk to people about incest, have incest-survivor groups, have rape-support groups. What does that have to do with the rape of women in Haiti? WeÃ¢Â€Â™re in Washington, D.C. WeÃ¢Â€Â™re in the United States. What does that have to do with the worker rights of women employees who clean buildings? I mean, connections were no longer made. They were not being encouraged. In fact, they were basically discouraged.References 21-22 - 1.05% CoverageWe are a service-oriented organization. We do education in the schools and we provide counseling. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s what we do, you know. And we go out and speak at the functions in the community, and raise the consciousness at other institutions, and when IÃ¢Â€Â™m saying raise the consciousness, what I actually mean is being made aware of the issues around sexual assault and how to deal with them. And that was pretty much becoming it. So, between board micro-management, not continuing to forge out and make those connections, losing many of the women of color because the issues that would keep the connections were not there, so we were coming to a place of ideological differences and being totally burnt out, because I worked like a Mississippi slave in a cotton field in those years when I worked at the Rape Crisis Center, that I served my community. I was just nuked. I just couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t Ã¢Â€Â” it was time for me to go. ROSS: What was happening nationally on the scene around women of color and violence against women during this time? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, there were some exciting things, because I always looked at it that there was the overall womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement and within the overall womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement, there was the women-of-color movement, because over time, many of the women of color had found ways to network and get to know each other and meet each other and do things. One of the things that we were involved in before we were even really very much involved in NCASA [National Committee Against Sexual Assault] was NCADV, National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which was much more radical in its thinking and its approach than was the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault. And within NCADV, they had those women of color caucuses, which was so very strong. All of the women, they had the black caucus, the Latina, the Asian, the First Nation, they had all of the Ã¢Â€Â” women of color had caucuses. Well, you know, NCADV was a national organization, so most of the shelters of the country were members of it, and you could see that there were many women of color working in all these shelters, and in crisis centers, which was like something that people just didnÃ¢Â€Â™t seem to know and didnÃ¢Â€Â™t seem to get, that there was all this strength here, and [NCADV], they produced a newsletter, as well as doing a womenÃ¢Â€Â™s newsletter. Some of the shelters did their newsletters, and the women-of-color caucus had a newsletter, and it was very powerful. And what I always appreciated about them was how they could meet as individual groupings and then come back together strong as a women-of-color caucus. So women of color were involved in the shelters, in the rape crisis centers, in the health movement Ã¢Â€Â” because they were also working in the health centers, working with womenÃ¢Â€Â™s health care Ã¢Â€Â” there were a number of cases going on from the 70s into the early 80s that raised a lot of consciousness about violence against women, and those cases were raised and that consciousness was raised through women of color.References 23-24 - 0.24% CoverageYou had Joanne Little.

TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes, yes, who tried to rape her when she was in prison, yes. So these four cases Ã¢Â€Â” Dessie Woods, Joanne Little, Inez Garcia, Yvonne Wanrow, were cases that raised national attention and brought out a lot of the contradictions, the conflict, you know, was played out and so, it was a very educational process for people who were paying attention.References 25-26 - 0.17% Coverage One of the reasons that I made a conscious choice to go ahead and deal with the Black United Front was because what I had found, was that in the time I had worked at the Rape Crisis Center, I had really developed some negative feelings about men, and I found it kind of coloring my attitudes, you know, because I had so much rape and so much pornography and domestic violence, and harassment, you know. It was, like, put them all in a plane and send them somewhere by themselves, you know. Reference 27 - 0.01% Coveragethe D.C. Rape Crisis CenterReference 28 - 1.02% CoverageBut here in D.C., one of the larger churches and the minister was accused of sexual harassment. And there were four women, and they were really, really upset and traumatized. And they were directed to, not just the Rape Crisis Center, they were directed to me, to work with them and support them and sit in on some of their meetings and so forth and so on. And this guy was actually charged, you know, with sexual harassment. And in the church, he ultimately, even though it was kind of close, but he ultimately won. Oh, no, not Ã¢Â€Â” you know. In the process, though, working with these women was just really Ã¢Â€Â” it was horrendous. And because the case was in the newspaper and that sort of thing. I was getting criticized, you know, for bringing down a good man, for messing with somebodyÃ¢Â€Â™s reputation or getting into the middle of something that wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t that serious. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not like he raped anybody, that sort of thing. And I can clearly remember one day, I was Ã¢Â€Â” two particular occasions. One, there was a man and woman together somewhere up in Northwest, and he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœArenÃ¢Â€Â™t you the woman at the Rape Crisis Center thatÃ¢Â€Â™s working with the women?Ã¢Â€Âù Ã¢Â€ÂœYes, I am.Ã¢Â€Âù Ã¢Â€ÂœHow are you going to just tear a black man down?Ã¢Â€Âù Kind of went into this, right? And the woman, the sister who was with him, she kind of pulled him up, you know, she was kind of, like, Why donÃ¢Â€Â™t you leave her alone? SheÃ¢Â€Â™s Ã¢Â€Â” weÃ¢Â€Â™re out here doing, to go to the movies. Why are you doing this? kind of thing. Which was the first time that I sort of realized, my goodness, this is kind of bigger than I realized it was. And then, I was walking across Malcolm X Park, and this guy says, Ã¢Â€ÂœArenÃ¢Â€Â™t you the woman whoÃ¢Â€Â™s helping those women against John?Ã¢Â€Âù His first name was John, I cannot remember his last name. I could go back and look this stuff up because I know I have it somewhere. And I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœYes.Ã¢Â€Âù And he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, whatÃ¢Â€Â™s wrong with you? Do you like men?Ã¢Â€Âù And I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœNo.Ã¢Â€Âù And he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, because youÃ¢Â€Â™re a lesbian.Ã¢Â€Âù What I really meant was I donÃ¢Â€Â™t like men like you, you know, small-minded and aggressive and rude. So, he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœYouÃ¢Â€Â™re a lesbian.Ã¢Â€Âù And so I just said something like, Ã¢Â€ÂœYouÃ¢Â€Â™d better watch your girlfriend,Ã¢Â€Âù because he just pissed me off. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know. But that was really stressful, and people at the Crisis Center really didnÃ¢Â€Â™t realize how significant this was that was going on. [The case of a woman suing a minister became a major polarizing issue in the black community.] Because this is, like, an out-in-the-open thing around sexual harassment, verbal sexual harassment stuff. You know, a little pat on the behind, this, that, and the other, that people had always known about in different places where they hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t come out like that Ã¢Â€Â“ ROSS: This was before Anita Hill. References 29-30 - 0.17% CoverageThe grand jury canÃ¢Â€Â™t make us testify. I remember, they came up into the D.C. Rape Crisis Center because Yulanda was a volunteer and on the board of the Rape Crisis Center, and so she was often at the Center. And when they, I guess, after they caught the people they were going to bring to trial, or when they determined that there was enough evidence for it to go to trial, whatever was their initial process, they came and served subpoenas at the Rape Crisis Center for people.References 31-32 - 0.15% Coverage The freedom to really hook the work aspects, the political aspects and the organizational and everything, as I did at the Rape Crisis Center, was not there. At the Rape Crisis Center, I practically did whatever it was I needed to do to advance the work of women, to advance the work of the Center, period, you know. So it didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have restrictions on being able to go to this conference or work in coalition with this group or do this or do that.References 33-34 - 0.26% Coverage. So then from there, itÃ¢Â€Â™s like, but in reality, this is an ideal because we donÃ¢Â€Â™t have these things, and these are things that we are struggling for in real basic ways, from how my body is being dealt with, how I have control or lack of control over my body, to what kind of contracts, et cetera, I can enter into without having to have a male force there guarantee whatever the particular situation calls for, to how I am perceived and used in that society in regard to things like conflict and aggression in places where women get caught in the middle, as in rape as a weapon of war. All of these different things are things that women are struggling and endeavoring to change, to bring about the justice in that area, the fairness, the equality in those areas.References 35-36 - 0.57% CoverageThatÃ¢Â€Â™s where we get those sayings like, The hearts of people are not conquered until the hearts of its women are on the ground. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s where, you know, all these different ideas come from in terms of resistance to this, but you see and you know that itÃ¢Â€Â™s true because, if not, why is it happening? When you talk about spoils of war, how is it that women, who are human beings, become a part of the spoils of war, do you know? That you demoralize a village by raping all the women in the village? That you have an idea that you can improve a race of people, lighten them up, make them more worthy, more acceptable by raping the women and having them rape Ã¢Â€Â” like in the Sudan with the Geneina, where theyÃ¢Â€Â™re talking about, you know, YouÃ¢Â€Â™re too black and we need lighter people in the Sudan. YouÃ¢Â€Â™re black, youÃ¢Â€Â™re ugly, you know. So youÃ¢Â€Â™re systematically trying to genocide out a people and bring about a new people Ã¢Â€Â” all of this through the wombs of women. I find this quite disturbing, quite terrifying, as a woman with a womb and a vagina. This kind of bothers me, you know. So you have all these places where these male-dominant attitudes prevail, not just on the level of conflict, but on the internal level within the society where these exist Ã¢Â€Â” in places in Africa where people believe that if you rape a virgin, that itÃ¢Â€Â™ll cure you of AIDS. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s like, whatever could you be saying? You know, itÃ¢Â€Â™s this idea in India that if the woman does something she disgraces the whole family and she must be punished, so, you know, we can just set her on fire, because we have to avenge the honor of this family.Reference 37 - 0.09% CoverageROSS: So you see your future work helping women in other countries deal with the consequences of rape being used as a weapon of war? Taking your experiences from building the movement to end violence against women here and globalizing it from the perspective of women of color?References 38-39 - 1.00% Coverage Wow. Well, first of all, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know if herstory can say it or history can say it or whatever. I know one thing is that in the 13 years that I worked at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, I served a lot of people and I helped a lot of people. And I still run into people sometimes who say, you know, I remember when you used to work at the Rape Crisis Center. You were my counselor. Or, You were the counselor for a friend of mine. Things like that. Because I counseled a lot of women when I worked at the Rape Crisis Center, and I feel good about that. Also doing the education in the schools, the program, I run into people who say, I remember when you came to my school. You came to Roosevelt. You came to Paul. You came to Hart. You came to Charles Drew. You came to my school. And that was really good. So I feel that I have touched a number of peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s lives in a personal way that may not ever get broadcast, and sometimes I think about, What if I had not ever worked at the Rape Crisis Center? There would have been these people who wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have got touched in that way that, you know, that you helped them to be able to heal theirselves and resolve their conflicts so their lives could be better. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s really good. Um, I think that the involvement of women of color at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, through the organizing for Anti-Rape Week and working with the people who organized the Take Back the Night marches and the very first Third World Women and Violence conference, national conference, held in this country, that though were only about 75 women or so that attended, it was a significant thing for the First National Conference on Third World Women and Violence. I think that I played a significant role in helping to shape and develop a network and a movement of like-minded, feminist-minded, whatever, third world women and women of color in the metropolitan area in doing work in the area of violence against women, you know, kind of coming together to study and to expand around violence against women, because we were looking at sexual assault, domestic violence. We were looking at street harassment, you know, we actually tried to get D.C. declared a hassle-free zone, free of the hassle, sexual, verbal harassment and hassling of women. I worked on the interfamily bill to change the definition and way of dealing with domestic violence and battering, on the rape bill. Just the consciousness of women around being active in gender politics, helping to facilitate this idea that we had to end the silence in our communities, and I think that all of these third world women of color, African American women, women in the Latino community, and so forth and so on, but definitely in the black community, of pushing and making dialog happen in our communities around us when people didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to hear it, you know, and challenging people and their ideas about it. Reference 40 - 0.36% CoverageROSS: But there was a book called How to Start a Rape Crisis Center.

TOURÃƒÂ‰: Barbara K Ã¢Â€Â” [Kletzick]. ROSS: Right (laughs). And Barbara pointed over to me and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, you need to talk to her.Ã¢Â€Âù And you could see their jaws drop when they realized that they had to talk to this bevy of black women about how to start a rape crisis center. And I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think they were prepared to do that. And I think you were there at that meeting.Reference 41 - 0.26% CoverageTOURÃƒÂ‰: Yeah, I remember that now. But when you first said South [Africa], my mind immediately went to the indigenous South African people, and so I was like, what? But now, I do remember that, just as I remember that when we went to Kenya for the end-of-the-decade conference, that our rape reference, the one on the myths and the facts and everything, that we had had the logo done with the faces of women of color, that it had spread itself so many places, and that wen we went, there were people who were somewhat familiar with it. But that once we returned, we just got all kinds of responses from people who had taken it back to their countries and were like using the logo and just using the information. And it was just amazing. It was so great.References 42-43 - 0.32% Coverage And another thing I think that is very Ã¢Â€Â” is that we did the first Anti-Rape Week in, well, it was actually, the first was just a weekend, and it ended with the march that Aegis and FAAR were organizing. That was like in 1978. I remember Sue Lerutes [sp? a white woman at the Rape Crisis Center] did the graphic work for the flyer. That that started out Ã¢Â€Â” it was like a weekend. We called it a week, but it was really a weekend because Ã¢Â€Â” and then it actually grew to being able to be a whole week of activities and so forth and so on that included the march. It included so many different aspects of sexual assault, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s how we were able to pull in so many women of color to work on it. And that, you know, it grew, and that the Rape Crisis Center, they changed to Rape Awareness Week, and then Rape Awareness Week became Rape Awareness Month because of NCASA, the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault.<Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Vazquez_Carmen> - § 4 references coded  [1.41% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.16% CoverageBut I remember waking up one night and hearing them arguing, and they Ã¢Â€Â” you know, you have mosquito nets and so I could see them arguing underneath the mosquito net.

You know, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not like I could actually see it, but I could hear. And you know, it just stayed. The image stayed forever. ANDERSON: Did you ever talk about it with her? VAZQUEZ: Not with my grandma. I actually Ã¢Â€Â” itÃ¢Â€Â™s an image and a story that I completely forgot about until I was in my thirties and some therapy thing Ã¢Â€Â” and boom, there it was. And then, the detail of it really didnÃ¢Â€Â™t come back to me until I wrote an essay called Ã¢Â€ÂœSpirit and Passion,Ã¢Â€Âù where I described the incident. And as I was writing it, I just Ã¢Â€Â” I really remembered all the details, my uncle in the night and the lamp and the whole Ã¢Â€Â” and so, she was dead by then. My grandma died, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know how many years ago. And so I never Ã¢Â€Â” no. ANDERSON: So, do you think that next morning you were still thinking about it, and just didnÃ¢Â€Â™t say anything to your grandmother about it? Or do you think that youÃ¢Â€Â™d already, by the next morning, sort of blocked it out.? Do you remember being around her and being afraid for her and upset about what you had witnessed? Or do you think you just really shoved it away immediately? VAZQUEZ: No, no, I think I did. I think I did. I mean, I remember my uncle that night, because I was crying and upset, my uncle holding me and taking care of me and telling me it was going to be all right. My uncle was maybe ten years older than me, ten or 12 years older than me, so he was, you know, a child himself, just a young teenager, and he had probably witnessed stuff like that before. So, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s my uncle Hernan, who also never married Ã¢Â€Â” number of bachelors in that family. I wonder what that was about. Anyway Ã¢Â€Â“ ANDERSON: It must have been a terrifying night for you. VAZQUEZ: It was a terrifying night. ANDERSON: Because the woman that is your protector, is your parent at that time, is being hurt. VAZQUEZ: Yeah. ANDERSON: Did you ever feel afraid in that house? Did that translate to him, to you feeling afraid of your grandfather? Was he ever mean or abusive to the kids? VAZQUEZ: Yeah, because I think before that, we just sort of didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have much to do with him. WeÃ¢Â€Â™d avoid him. He was, you know, the gruff guy, whatever. And after that, I was afraid of him. Forever. For the rest of my life. And actually, he Ã¢Â€Â” there was an incident later in New York where he actually exposed himself to myself and my cousin Evie and, you know, we were, like, six years old or something like that.

We were really settled in the business, we were doing fairly well. Things were going well. Our own personal relationship, I felt, was going really well. We were more mature than what weÃ¢Â€Â™d ever been and comfortable with one another. In other words, I felt safe, you know, I felt safe. And so, at one point in time we had hired somebody to drive with us, to drive for us, and he couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t drive for some reason, he was sick or something. So we were each operating a truck, and we had done that some, because we had three trucks at the time, so we took on a lot. We had a little trucking business of our own. And so, there were times when I would operate the truck by myself, and it allowed me to think, I think. You know, youÃ¢Â€Â™re by yourself then and so on. And of course in Ã¢Â€Â™89, that was two years, I think, after my niece had revealed that my father had sexually abused her. And at that point in time, I still wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t admit even to myself that we had Ã¢Â€Â“ that I had been abused. I just said, it didnÃ¢Â€Â™t happen in my family.

IÃ¢Â€Â™m not going to think about, that it goes back further enough in your brain so that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t think about it and you just Ã¢Â€Â“ itÃ¢Â€Â™s like itÃ¢Â€Â™s a cutoff there. And I say a cutoff, it was almost like there was a curtain drawn there, and yo donÃ¢Â€Â™t draw that curtain back. Because if you do, God forbid. And thatÃ¢Â€Â™s what it was like. And then, it was almost like when I started to look at what was behind that curtain, there was just like a flood of stuff that came out. And that was all the stuff that I had just stored back there, and had chosen not to talk about it or not even think about for years, since I had left home as a child, really since the time I had been 13 or so. I just, you just donÃ¢Â€Â™t think about it. It was very easy to do all those years, I think, because there was so much else going on. Harold and I were married and we had his family to think about because his father died. And then my family expected me to solve all of their problems. Whenever anything went wrong, they came to Wynona to solve the problems, and the same with HaroldÃ¢Â€Â™s family. They came to him. So it was just Ã¢Â€Â“ you know, it was Ã¢Â€Â“ there was so much other going on. Then we had the trucks and we were on road and I ran the business, essentially. And I ran the business side of it and Harold did the mechanical side and ran that part of it. And then we shared the driving. So our lives were really, really hectic and busy. And at that point in time, I think I felt safe enough and secure enough, and was with Harold enough at that point in time so that I could be comfortable and talk about it, and really re-live some of the stuff that went on. And it was a hard time. But it brought Harold and I really close. FOLLET: It did? WARD: Oh, yeah. Because he was there. He was like my everyday shrink, someone that could Ã¢Â€Â“ was further enough away from it so it was like he could be almost an objective person about it. Not really, because in some ways, but in other ways he could be. In other ways, he could confirm things for me, too, because heÃ¢Â€Â™d known me since I was 13. FOLLET: Right. WARD: I remember when I went to the doctor about whether I had a learning disability or not and I came home and said she wanted me to think about back when I was kid, you know, where there some things I was behind in developing. And I said, YouÃ¢Â€Â™ve known me since I was 13. What do you think? And he has this dry sense of humor, so he said, Well, youÃ¢Â€Â™ve always been a klutz. (laugh). And itÃ¢Â€Â™s true. And itÃ¢Â€Â™s more than likely because of the learning disability that I have, which was caused from domestic violence. My balance isnÃ¢Â€Â™t good. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s never been good. And I have a hard time with that. And so itÃ¢Â€Â™s things like that that he has seen and realized about me, that others wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have known, because heÃ¢Â€Â™s known me for so long. But at that time, yeah, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s when I really started thinking about it and studying about it and reading about it and realizing that this is what happened in our family. And of course, when my niece revealed that sheÃ¢Â€Â™d been abused by my father and we went through that whole ordeal, then it was like my sisters and I were really close for a while, a period there, and then we just all pulled apart and went our own separate ways because it was so hard to deal with, so hard to deal with. And they had their families and I was on the road and all of that, and it was very, very difficult to deal with. And they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to deal with it. Nobody wanted to deal with it anymore. Just the same thing as always had happened in the past -- put in on the back burner, itÃ¢Â€Â™ll go away and it wonÃ¢Â€Â™t happen again. But I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t let that happen. Instead, I delved into it, and I really wanted to find out what it was all about, and so I did a lot of research on my own. And this was before I was at Vermont College. Whether it was in a bookstore, because when we were hauling different loads, we were in the cities and so on and I could go to a bookstore or wherever and research a lot like that, or could buy books from on the road, and had time to read on the road, where they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t and they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to deal with it, and so I could pick up these books and read different books about it. I read Judith Lewis HermanÃ¢Â€Â™s book Father-Daughter Incest. I read Carol Gilligan. I read her book and different books like that I was reading. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s when, I think, how I got my first look at feminism and women and that type of thing was through those books, through Carol Gilligan and Judith Lewis Herman, really. And they were on my own, when I was on the road at that point in time. And I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t doing it for school, I was just doing it for myself. The Courage to Heal book, I read that then. Other books about child abuse, and feminist books then, too -- Gloria Steinem and some of those things. I was picking them up and reading them on my own. FOLLET: You were. WARD: Yeah, while we were on the road. FOLLET: Do you remember any ah-hah moments of particular books or particular ideas that really hit home? WARD: Well, of course, Judith Lewis HermanÃ¢Â€Â™s book Father-Daughter Incest was oh, my God, this is our family. You know, I really think I was at Vermont College before I really started talking about a lot of it. FOLLET: Hm. You talked to Howard, I mean Harold. Sorry. You talked to Harold and you did reading on your own. Did you seek any assistance or- WARD: When things got difficult and I was going through some of the childhood stuff, I saw a psychiatrist for about eight months or so, whenever I could. It was kind of once a week but not really. And just around the psychological stuff of whatÃ¢Â€Â™s going on and how do I handle this and I donÃ¢Â€Â™t want to see my mother and father anymore and confronting them about what went on and so on, and saw him for about that length of time. And the rest of it was really on my own. I had a friend in California who had Ã¢Â€Â“ she had gotten a lot into feminism and that type of thing and so different articles and so on she would refer to me and I would read them, and really started researching on my own on it. FOLLET: At that point, as you started to come References 4-6 - 1.79% CoverageWARD: I think I thought, no wonder IÃ¢Â€Â™m so screwed up. (long hearty laugh). Really, I think I did. I thought, God, no wonder. No wonder this and no wonder that, after what I grew up in, you know. And you began to filter that through. This is an example. I remember Harold, all the time we were working I worked in Hanover and he worked in White River, and he would come over, and I would walk down from Hanover and sit on the New Hampshire side of the Ledyard Bridge at the Connecticut River and he would have to come over and pick me up because I wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t walk across that bridge. I was deathly scared of walking across bridges with water underneath them. It was all right if they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have water underneath it. And I never knew why, never could figure out why, and one time, I remember I came in and he had dropped me off in Vermont. And Harold said, Well, how are you going to get across? I said, Oh, I can do it now. Because I had remembered a time when my father tried to drown me when I was like a year and a half or so old. He was giving me a bath and he was fondling me and I was protesting it and so, heÃ¢Â€Â™d stick me under the water, stick my head under the water, and I almost Ã¢Â€Â“ I couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t breathe. And once I remembered that and dealt with that happening and dealt with that fear, I can walk across bridges with water under them all the time now. And I said that to Andy. I said, You know, I wanted to just stand there, walk back and forth, back and forth across that bridge. And he says, Well, that probably wouldÃ¢Â€Â™ve been all right. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™d have just brought you here anyways. (laugh) And thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the different things that you learn that have stuck with you from what happened to you when you were a child, have come up and you deal with them, and then those fears go away. I could never figure out why I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to stay home alone, and there were times when I would not. I would have someone come stay with me or IÃ¢Â€Â™d go stay with someone, and it was all because of the fear of what went on in the nighttime, which is when my father usually abused us. And now, you work through that and I can stay in fine by myself. FOLLET: Uh, huh. WARD: You know, you just work through those things. What it did at that time was [phone rings, voice in background], it allowed me to have respect for myself, to have empathy that I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have before, so that was good. FOLLET: Yeah. Um, - WARD: It was about that time, too, that we left from New England and started going cross-country on the trucks and it was after we had dealt with my father. No, let me think. No, that was Ã¢Â€Â™93. Oh, and see, we were on the road again, and that was when my niece revealed that she had been abused by my brother. And so during those years I had been doing all this research and so on and learning about child abuse and learning about families, incestuous families and so on (phone rings in background) and so again, the family all turned to me. But I had a good idea of what to do about it then. Much more than what they did, and I knew what needed to happen to help her, and what the rest of the family needed to do. Psychologically I knew. I knew about that. I knew about it being passed down through the generations and who abused who and those different kinds of things. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t know the law. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t know the law. I knew a lot of the psychological stuff I had learned on my own. I had learned about myself and about other people that went through it and so on.References 7-8 - 0.92% Coverage It really did, because the stuff I was learning on my own, a lot of that Ã¢Â€Â“ some of it came from Freud, and Bowen is not Freud. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s the whole family, and so I began to understand that it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t just victim-perpetrator, that the whole family in some ways were involved. And what I mean by that is that one person in the family moves and it causes everybody else to move. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s like a mobile. You move one part of it and all the rest of it moves. And that was part of the reason why when my family Ã¢Â€Â“ it was at that time when my family still was turned against me -- my mother, my father, my brother, my oldest sister, and how wrong I was and that the reason that Richard was in jail was because I had put him there and it was a conspiracy because I was mad at my mother and father for what they had done and that I was a liar and I was crazy and I was nuts and I was making up all of this and nobody wanted to believe or accept or admit what I said was true. Um, and those members of the family and a lot of the extended family members, too, that were still all bound in this horror of child abuse and spouse abuse. One of the things I learned from Bowen is if I can just stay my own, eventually others in the family will change, and that did happen. It happened Ã¢Â€Â“ I mean, my younger sisters and so on, they believed what I said and added to it, what had happened to them. And eventually, my brother came around and said, yes, there were other cousins and nieces and nephews that said, yes, weÃ¢Â€Â™ve been abused, too, and eventually my older sister admitted it and my mother has and my brother did before he died. Now there are more people in the family that admit it and say, yes, this happened, than the other that say, no. I really have just one uncle left that still denies.References 9-10 - 0.13% CoverageWARD: And I think, you know, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s what I thought about my own family, too. IÃ¢Â€Â™m not going to see the domestic violence or the child abuse stop in the world, but itÃ¢Â€Â™s stopped so that my great nieces and nephews now wonÃ¢Â€Â™t [01:02:44: END TAPE 2].References 11-12 - 1.18% CoverageWARD: Yes, a public spokesperson. My sisters speak openly, my younger sisters, about what happened to them and how wrong it was and how traumatic it was. And they talk amongst their friends or with me or other professionals or whatever. But theyÃ¢Â€Â™re not a public spokesman for it like I am. But they support me. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™ve heard me speak and listened and have participated in some of the efforts that I have made, whether itÃ¢Â€Â™s interviewing with reporters or, you know, just giving information and so on. And so theyÃ¢Â€Â™ve been helpful. But their lives focus around their childrenÃ¢Â€Â™s lives. Where IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been more of a spokesman for it and said that this is wrong and it needs to change and this is how we can change it. And I think thatÃ¢Â€Â™s because Ã¢Â€Â“ I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know if itÃ¢Â€Â™s because they have children and that has to be their everyday focus. But, in the same instance, IÃ¢Â€Â™ll tell you that one of my nieces -- she will be here tomorrow, sheÃ¢Â€Â™s meeting a client here, a mutual client, and asking that I represent the children in the case where there has been child sexual abuse. And so that niece is out there working. She works in a child psychology type position, a case manager position for one of the local mental health centers in the area, so she is actively out there and she has three children, but sheÃ¢Â€Â™s actively out there in this area. I have another niece who, in New Jersey, works with the elderly now in nursing homes and so on and does a lot to make sure that the elderly arenÃ¢Â€Â™t abused. Now thatÃ¢Â€Â™s a niece that my nephew married. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not a direct blood relation, but Ã¢Â€Â“ so there are people in my family that go into the social service area and I think a lot of that is because they see the need and realize Ã¢Â€Â“ as the generations come down, even though that generation was not abused, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re still affected by it. You know, just like you talk about the Holocaust. One of my best friends, sheÃ¢Â€Â™s a doctor in Ann Arbor Ã¢Â€Â“ her mother was a victim of the Holocaust. So she wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t, but it affects her still. It affects the generations after that. And so I think thatÃ¢Â€Â™s something that even though my great-nieces and nephews will not be abused, that they will still be affected by what happened in their familiesReferences 13-14 - 1.53% CoverageWARD: I think itÃ¢Â€Â™s because I want people to realize. I recently said, and this is an example, to an opposing client who has finally admitted that he abused his wife and is going into a battererÃ¢Â€Â™s intervention program, and we were dealing with supervised visitation for this child, and I said to him, When you get into your battererÃ¢Â€Â™s group, you talk with your facilitator. I will be happy to come. Because he was trying to say that the child was only 2 when the battering went on and she didnÃ¢Â€Â™t really see any of it. So I said, I remember back, vividly, when I was 2 years old and there was abuse going on in my family. And when you get into your group, you ask your facilitator if I can come and talk to you in your group so that you will know what it feels like to be a child and have your parents abusing one another, I said, or to have your father beating your mother. I said, I will be happy to come and talk to you about that and read to yo some of my writings about what that experience is like. I said, Then you will know what itÃ¢Â€Â™s like to be a child and know what it feels like to be abused and how traumatic and how frightening it is. Because I think that is the way, if I can reach people with that message, that they will realize that it has to stop, that it canÃ¢Â€Â™t continue on, because if it does, then thatÃ¢Â€Â™s what weÃ¢Â€Â™re doing to our future generations that we expect to take care of us and expect to take care of the world. So I think itÃ¢Â€Â™s very important. I often say we will not stop street violence and we will not stop school violence until we stop violence in the home. Because as I said to you yesterday, even though things go on at school that you know are not acceptable at school and theyÃ¢Â€Â™re acceptable at home, deep down inside you learn that itÃ¢Â€Â™s acceptable anywhere, and you can bring it from the home into the school and onto the streets and so if you can stop it in the home, I think thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the key to where it all starts. And, you know, if - the whole idea that women need to be equal with men and can be equal with men. One of the things that has always turned me against the Bible and against religion is that my father would quote from the Bible while he was, you know, the next minute abusing my mother or abusing one of his daughters, as if he were supported by the Bible for doing this, and would turn it all around. So for a long time I was against the teachings of the Bible, but now, I can look at it more objectively and realize that yes, itÃ¢Â€Â™s very patriarchal, especially the Old Testament, which is what he would quote from, but now I can look at it and realize that that was the way he interpreted it. FOLLET: Did he quote actual passage to justify actual abuse? WARD: He would Ã¢Â€Â“ well, you read the Bible. Nowhere in the Bible does it prohibit father-daughter incest. It prohibits everything else Ã¢Â€Â“ brother-sister, um, mother-son, and everything, but father-daughter incest is not prohibited.References 15-16 - 0.31% Coverage So if they come to me, I try to provide them with as much as I can, although IÃ¢Â€Â™m not a counselor, but I try to hook them up with and point them in the right direction to get the counseling that they need. We do provide some counseling in the Women in Transition group, the support group. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s more like an education and mentoring group, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not run by a psychologist or a counselor. We have people come in that speak with them about the various issues that they want to cover and itÃ¢Â€Â™s always domestic violence and child abuse. They want to cover that, and I do most of the education on that. Reference 17 - 0.49% CoverageAnd I think thatÃ¢Â€Â™s where we need to do more work, especially in rural areas, that itÃ¢Â€Â™s not acceptable. I feel that child sexual abuse is just now where spouse abuse was probably twenty years ago. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s just weÃ¢Â€Â™re really beginning to say itÃ¢Â€Â™s not OK and we have to do something about it. So I think that because of the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s movement that started those groups, we wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t Ã¢Â€Â“ I wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t be able to do the work that I do today without that first happening. That had to happen so there would be shelters for women to go to, there would be the ability in the legal system to get a relief-from-abuse order, to get a restraining order. My mother couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t do that, you know, there was no Ã¢Â€Â“ she couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have that. When my mother went to a doctor for help, he treated whatever her bruises were or whatever her ailments were but didnÃ¢Â€Â™t ask where they came from. And the church encouraged people to stay married.Reference 18 - 0.61% Coverage FOLLET: Yes, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s right. And she was telling me a story, that she came up to Vermont in the early Ã¢Â€Â™90s, maybe Ã¢Â€Â™92, Ã¢Â€Â™93, to a conference. It was for survivors of sexual abuse, the conference was, and there were 400 people there. And she offered a workshop on dealing with offenders. Not a single person came. A couple of years later, she was invited to give the keynote in Vermont to a conference sponsored by coalitions of rape crisis centers and services and victim advocacy groups, invited to give the keynoe on her work in working with offenders. And because it was the keynote, of course, people did attend. But she said she was met with a kind of stunned silence, almost bordering on hostility. And she knew that Vermont, at the same time, had one Ã¢Â€Â“ nationally, one of the most recognized programs for treating, providing treatment to offenders as, I guess, part of the criminal Ã¢Â€Â“ WARD: ItÃ¢Â€Â™s the Department of Corrections. FOLLET: -- system, so very advanced in that respect, and yet the women who were survivors and organizations like rape crisis centers who were dealing with this issue were really not ready to touch working with offenders. Reference 19 - 0.13% CoverageAnd so because that went on for so many years, and still goes on, I think, like in rape cases, where they blame the victim, they put the victim on the stand and abuse her all over again, which can happen in domestic violence cases, too, domestic assault cases. Reference 20 - 0.99% CoverageAnd I think that itÃ¢Â€Â™s really important that we realize that thatÃ¢Â€Â™s out there and that it can affect our children, and that it can be devastating for them, especially when you hear of -- whether itÃ¢Â€Â™s older men or older women who will get on the internet with these young people and pretend that theyÃ¢Â€Â™re a young person and come meet me and then you hear of children being killed or raped or the circumstance that happens from that type of connection to pornography. In the same voice, -- and this stems from my law school education, I think, too -- in one of my last cases, it was brought up because he had porn in his house and he was an abuser, and we mentioned it, and that he was showing it to his 6year-old son as if this was an accepted way of life, and we brought it up as a fact that it was not an acceptable parenting skill, that that showed that he did not have any parenting skills. So IÃ¢Â€Â™ve used it that way as such, but I also realize that the Constitution gives adults the right to observe and look at porn as part of the Constitution. Do you see what I mean? And so you get that battle going back and forth. Personally, I feel that if women are looked at as sexual, their bodies are just looked at as sexual bodies, then youÃ¢Â€Â™re not thinking about their mind, youÃ¢Â€Â™re not thinking about their worth, youÃ¢Â€Â™re not thinking about what they can give to society or a relationship, or, you know, that type of thing. So I think we could do without it without any problem. I wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t hesitate at all to use it in my cases if this was Ã¢Â€Â“ and I have already done it, that this shows an inappropriate parenting skill, if thatÃ¢Â€Â™s what was happening, if they were being shown to children. And I think as far as bringing children into that, and that type of thing, itÃ¢Â€Â™s terrible and it needs to be stopped, just the same as child abuse needs to be stopped. Child porn is part of child abuse.<Files\\SCVF\\SCVF_Winslow_Barbara> - § 4 references coded  [1.66% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.27% Coverage WINSLOW: I think I was a mass of contradiction. I was a bleached-blond cheerleader with the nickname of Bubbles who went on civil rights demonstrations. You canÃ¢Â€Â™t get anything more contradictory than that. And at my fortieth reunion, I talked about how I donÃ¢Â€Â™t even regret being a cheerleader because IÃ¢Â€Â™m always good on demonstrations. I know how to get the crowds going and I tell my womenÃ¢Â€Â™s studies students that. So, I mean, I think maybe being a nonconformist or what have you had to do with the fact that on the one hand, I wanted to be popular, but I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t. I wanted to be stereotypically attractive. I wanted a boyfriend. I wanted to do well in school. But on the other hand, there was something seething in me, and when I went away to this private school, IÃ¢Â€Â™d come back from a trip to Europe and I got into fights. I mean, think of it: I got into fights with these kids about free love! They thought it was shocking. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t believe in marriage. In high school, all you want to do is sleep around. You know, I mean, your hormones are raging. They were shocked at me for that. I was so disliked that the boys named the football dummy, the tackling dummy, after me. Think about that in terms of sexual abuse and violence against women. And I loved the school I was at, and I struggled with it, but it helped make me whatever I am today, if thatÃ¢Â€Â™s good, bad, or indifferent. But I went back to my school to talk about womenÃ¢Â€Â™s issues. They always invite me to speak. And at one point the new headmaster, who was two years younger than me, and had heard about me. At one point, without thinking, he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœBarbara, youÃ¢Â€Â™re really nice.Ã¢Â€Âù And I looked at him and he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou know, the tackling dummy was named after you.Ã¢Â€Âù And it was like, it brought back to me how disliked I was. And his wife, you could just see she was kicking him under the table. And he all of a sudden had this stricken look Ã¢Â€Â” because I know I had a stricken look for a moment Ã¢Â€Â” that this was something. You know, the boys did not like me, and one time we had this co-ed hockey game and the boys came after me with the hockey sticks and I ended up smacking them, I mean, really fighting back. So I think part of me, the combativeness in me, was sort of part of me struggling to figure out who I wanted to be and what I was going to be. So Solebury was very nonconformist. I was at the U.N. demonstrating against the United States in the Cuban Missile Crisis. I mean, we all thought we were going be blown up. And so I got involved in the peace movement through that.Reference 3 - 0.31% CoverageAnd I think that once you move the process from building the movement to building the institutions Ã¢Â€Â” the institutions are very, very important, and donÃ¢Â€Â™t get me wrong, IÃ¢Â€Â™m not saying they arenÃ¢Â€Â™t, but they have an unintended result of almost conservatism. IÃ¢Â€Â™m not saying right wing, but Seattle formed the first rape crisis clinic in the country. Now, youÃ¢Â€Â™re going to form a rape crisis clinic. It means you have to develop relationships with the police, you have to know about the law, you have to find a space, all these things, which means that you have to change your approach and what you want to do and so forth.Reference 4 - 0.08% Coverage Rapist men were not considered violent. They were only violent if they killed the woman or if they beat her up.

In your papers that are at Smith College, you have a biographical statement that you wrote. In it you talk about some instances of sexual violence that happened. I wonder if you'd be willing to just talk a little bit about those. Gartrell: [00:04:30] When I was six years old, we lived next door to a physician who had three sons. One of them was a teenager. He and a friend of his lured me and my brother over to their treehouse and said, "Wouldn't you like to come see our treehouse?"ù He said, "You go up first"  to me and I started climbing, and I said, "Come on, Greg" [to my brother]. And he [the neighbor] said, "No, no, you wait down there."ù They wouldn't let him up. They got me up there, and they had a .22 rifle and they pointed the rifle at me and demanded that I engage in sexual activity with them, which I don't think there's a point in describing, but it was phenomenally traumatic. I thought that they were going to kill me, and they threatened to come get me if I told anyone. What happened afterwards was I got down, and I burst into tears and ran to my home. My mother and father were both home at the time. My father examined me physically, which was further embarrassing, and then went over and screamed at the neighbors and told them he was calling the police. Then they consulted--I don't know whom--who said that it would be very traumatic for me to go to court to testify against these boys, and it was better just to leave [it as it was, with] whatever threat my father made against them. We lived in that house for another year and a half. I was terrified every single day. I was terrified every single night. I was afraid they were going to crawl into my window. I actually was terrified throughout the rest of my childhood about the prospect of being raped or assaulted after that incident. Marine-Street: Were there any ramifications for the assaulters? Gartrell: [00:06:35] None whatsoever. When we moved to a new home far across town from where they lived, there was an unfortunate response on my mothers part to a question I asked in a veiled way, hoping that it wouldn't be obvious why I was asking the question. I said to her, "Do you think there's any chance those neighbors know where we live now?"ù She said, "Oh, of course, I'm sure they know,"ù which just took away any feeling of safety that I could have had at this new home. Marine-Street: Did you get any kind of counseling or help? Gartrell: [00:07:13] No. 18 Marine-Street: What did they call what happened to you in those days? Gartrell: [00:07:22] Teenage boys acting badly. Marine-Street: Has your understanding of that changed over time? Gartrell: [00:07:32] It was sexual violence at gunpoint and very, very, very traumatic. Marine-Street: You also mentioned to me that you almost were kidnapped. Was that about that same time? Gartrell: [00:07:48] It was a few years later. We lived next to a lemon orchard. Our house backed up against the lemon orchard. We were not a family of means. We lived in a small track house in Santa Barbara. Our school bus dropped us off about, I would say, a fifteen-minute walk from my home. I had seen a car that followed the school bus frequently, and it was an old man driving an old car. On most days when we were dropped off, there were many of us children. On this particular day, I was the only one. I got off the bus, and I was walking in a fairly leisurely way next to the lemon orchard to my home. This car pulled up next to me, and he rolled down his window, and he said, "You need to get in. You need to get in."ù He looked very frightening to me, and I started running, and he started following me. There was enough room where he could follow me off the road. I started screaming and running, and I ran through the lemon orchard [so] he couldn't take his car through the lemon orchard. I got into my house the back way and went into my room and looked out the window, and I saw that he was cruising by trying to find me. I told my parents. They then called the police and they allegedly looked for this person, but I [often] saw the car [parked] within a mile of our home and no one ever apprehended 19 the person. It was another instance in which, again, there was a complete lack of feeling safe. Marine-Street: What did you do as a child after those instances to kind of make yourself feel safe? Gartrell: [00:09:57] I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t feel safe. I felt frightened all the time. I felt frightened in my home, outside of my home. I was always afraid of being raped. I was always afraid of being assaulted. Marine-Street: How can you function if you're always afraid? Gartrell: [00:10:12] There are a lot of things that contributed to fear in my life and my parents unfortunately were not psychologically healthy. There was major mental illness in my family so I had that factor contributing to my state of not feeling safe. My father had severe panic disorder, and he was pretty much afraid of the world and afraid of going anywhere. When you have a role model of one parent who is afraid of the world and another parent who was quite mentally ill in a different way, it's not an environment in which a child grows up being given an opportunity to feel safe. On top of that, I then had teachers who hit on me before I left for college. For instance, when I was a tenth grade student, I had a Latin teacher who said to me he wanted to start driving me home. I thought that I needed to comply with that, [but when I] told my father and mother, they said, "Well, he can come here and meet us, but he's not driving you home." He touched me in ways that were very creepy. Touched my body and his hands were not where they should be. I mean, here I was doing well academically and having somebody trying to paw me and trying to drive me home.References 5-6 - 3.19% Coverage Gartrell: [00:37:33] IÃ¢Â€Â™ll say something about encounter groups. The summer before we entered Stanford, to my knowledge, every one of us received a letter offering the opportunity to participate in an encounter group when we arrived. It was described as an opportunity to have a member of the Counseling and Testing Center meet with a small group of us to talk about our experiences and to get to know one another well and share things that we might not feel comfortable sharing just in general. But, you know, in a safe environment. I read it. My parents read it. At first I thought, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhy not, it sounds good.Ã¢Â€Âù My parents read it and thought, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, wow, free therapy. Great. So do it.Ã¢Â€Âù I signed up to do it and we met. In my group, for some strange reason, my RA who happened to become my lover was in my group but there were no other women. There were about five other men and then we had a male who was a member of the 32 Counseling and Testing Center staff running the group. We met in Escondido--in one of the Escondido apartments--I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know if theyÃ¢Â€Â™re still called Escondido Apartments. Are they still called that? The tall buildings that are across from the firehouse. Marine-Street: I think they are--Escondido, yes. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™re doing a lot of reconstruction up there right now. Gartrell: [00:39:00] I know. EverythingÃ¢Â€Â™s changing. There were apartments that senior students could live in. So two women who were seniors lived there, and they allowed us to use their apartment. It was clear from the very beginning that the conversations were going in the direction of sex and talking about sexual feelings and that was something that seemed to be thrilling to the men to be able to do and felt creepy to me. Early into these meetings, we were told to pair off and there were all those kinds of touchy-feely things that were done back then in group dynamics where you close your eyes and, you know, see what you can communicate to another person through holding their hands like this and things like that. That kind of pairing off, we were given some instructions about that. I found out later that the woman who became my lover, my RA, and the man she was paired off with--what he did was he reached around, undid her bra, and was feeling her breasts during that encounter. That made me feel incredibly freaked out. She didnÃ¢Â€Â™t complain. She just went along with it. She was sexually involved with men before she became involved with me. I guess, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know, some number of sessions later, we arrived and the group leader was on the couch holding the hands and stroking one of the women 33 who lived in the apartment. He said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, letÃ¢Â€Â™s resume later.Ã¢Â€Âù She went into the bedroom, and we started our meeting and he stopped it after, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know, five or ten minutes. And he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou know, I have some unfinished business to do with whatÃ¢Â€Â™s-her-name and so why donÃ¢Â€Â™t you carry on without me.Ã¢Â€Âù We kind of, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know, carried on somehow without him. I had to go to the bathroom, and I got up to go to the bathroom, and the door to the room was open and they were having sex. And I, from other women classmates, heard similar stories of power and sex abuse by these people who supposedly represented mental health professionals affiliated with Stanford, which was just appalling. Marine-Street: Was he a student? Gartrell: [00:41:43] No, he was a member of the Counseling and Testing Center staff in the Dean of Students Office at the Old Union. Marine-Street: The girl that he was having sex with was an older student? Gartrell: [00:41:55] Student, yes. She was a senior. Marine-Street: But an undergraduate? Gartrell: [00:41:57] Yes. Marine-Street: Well thatÃ¢Â€Â™s an encounter group I guess. Gartrell: [00:42:01] Yes, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s an encounter of a sort. Marine-Street: Yes, of a sort. Anything else on that topic? You wrote somewhere that it was Ã¢Â€Âœan environment of daily sexual harassmentÃ¢Â€Âù during that time. Gartrell: [00:42:14] Yes. It was. Another illustration of the kind of commentary that was just routine and so irritating when it happened was initially when I got there, I guess miniskirts werenÃ¢Â€Â™t in fashion yet, but they kind of became in 34 fashion. I wore skirts and shorts. I wore a lot of shorts while it was hot and then I wore skirts some of the time. Actually, they were culotte skirts so that they were kind of like shorts. And my skirts got somewhat shorter as time went on because that was the fashion. I happened to generally make my own clothes because we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have the money to buy them. As I came out and became involved in--or had much more awareness of--feminism and got really excited about the beginning of the second wave of feminism, I started changing my clothing style and wearing clothes that were comfortable, not clothes that attracted attention from men. Because my short skirts--well, I mean, I figured all women attracted attention from men--but I felt that the way I dressed attracted attention and it was unwanted attention. I started wearing comfortable clothes that felt so good and so safe. That included overalls and turtlenecks when it was cold. One of my classmates said to me, after I had started wearing these clothes, turned over to me before our class started and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou know I liked you a lot better when you were wearing miniskirts. You really look terrible in overalls.Ã¢Â€Âù Marine-Street: This is a male classmate? Gartrell: [00:44:26] A male classmate. Marine-Street: How did you respond? Do you remember? Gartrell: [00:44:29] I just looked kind of horrified and I felt just invaded, and I felt it was an indication of this kind of entitlement to dictate the clothing of a classmate and very aware of the difference in my feeling of safety wearing overalls and a turtleneck versus a short skirt.References 7-9 - 4.17% CoverageMarine-Street: One more question related to this. Did you have any knowledge of sexual assaults that were occurring on campus? Was that something that happened then? Gartrell: [00:49:00] Yes, we were told periodically about rapes that happened and women being assaulted outside our dorm. This was starting our first year at Stanford. The lighting was very poor. Our bikes were parked in really dim lighting. I already came to Stanford as a frightened person--worrying about assault and violence. This was not helpful to me at all. We did, as our peer group of women, talk about our fears of going to the library at night. I was petrified of going to the library at night because it involved going out to get my bike where it was dimly lit, where anyone could be grabbed, riding my bike through dark streets to the library, and at both of those places locking the 37 bike. All of these things, if thereÃ¢Â€Â™s nobody else around, made me quite vulnerable and then being in the library, studying until whatever hour, and then making my way back. I was petrified. I mean, from the moment I left the dorm I was petrified. The whole process of thinking about going to the library made me petrified, which meant that I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t go as often as I wanted to or needed to, which meant that I felt that my [education suffered]. Well, I mean, it was my choice about safety or my fears about safety that prevented me from making adequate uses of the library. At that time, there were no [alarm boxes]. I know now that it seems like every twenty feet, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s an alarm box and I also know that there is [00:50:53] a lot of attention to safety. IÃ¢Â€Â™m not talking about the kind of safety that involves drinking alcohol and saying no. IÃ¢Â€Â™m talking about just trying to go to the library or trying to go to a night class. I mean, there were things that were happening at night that unless I was going as a member of a group, it didnÃ¢Â€Â™t feel safe attending. Marine-Street: Did you and any of the other women students do anything to try to feel more safe? Gartrell: [00:51:25] No, we just didnÃ¢Â€Â™t feel safe and--I mean, it didnÃ¢Â€Â™t occur to us that we had an opportunity to do anything. Marine-Street: Was there any kind of like self-defense courses or anything? Gartrell: [00:51:37] I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember what year it was, but I think it was probably my senior year that a self-defense course was offered, not as an elective but just as a campus activity, and I took it. I found out about it however--going to school at a time when there was no internet, any information you received 38 was word-of-mouth, you happened to have the time to read a flyer in White Plaza, or you happened to have time to read the Stanford Daily, or you had access to the Daily regularly, which I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t always, especially if I was living off-campus. It was really a matter of luck if you found out about something that you really wanted to do and needed to do. But somehow I found out about it. I attended this class and I loved it. I loved the concept of being taught that I was entitled to pay attention to my fears and that whenever I did feel afraid--whenever something happened that made me feel more afraid--I should pay attention to my feelings because they were a good indicator of my potential risk. My lover who had sex with men before she met me, [and] had sex with men throughout the time she was with me--she was not comfortable being lesbian, didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to identify as lesbian, wanted to get married, [and] spent the whole time that I was at Stanford looking for a man to marry at the same time she was involved with me--always said, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, youÃ¢Â€Â™re just a wimp, you know, stop being so afraid. What are you so afraid of? YouÃ¢Â€Â™re so afraid of sex with men? Why are you so uptight? YouÃ¢Â€Â™re just incredibly uptight?Ã¢Â€Âù Always the message, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou are really, really uptight.Ã¢Â€Âù To have this validation in this self-defense class that paying attention to [my feeling of fear]--granted, I came from a background of more fear that I carried within me than I wish I ever did--but that if something kicked it up to a higher level, that my feelings were valid and I needed to pay attention to them and I needed to do something about them immediately. Then to learn self-defense techniques to fight or to fight back or to release myself was 39 fabulous. It was such an incredible opportunity to have--to create a sense of empowerment. Marine-Street: Was it a male instructor, do you remember? Gartrell: [00:54:27] Absolutely not. It was all women. Marine-Street: All women? Gartrell: [00:54:29] Yes, I wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have taken a course from a man because how could a man possibly have come from our experience and seen the world in the way we saw the world? Marine-Street: It was another student that was doing it? Do you recall? Gartrell: [00:54:45] Yes, I believe it was another student or somebody from offcampus who came. Marine-Street: Do you remember where they taught the classes? Gartrell: [00:54:52] They were taught in the Roble Gym. Marine-Street: Does anything stick with you about what they taught you like specific techniques? Gartrell: [00:55:03] They were techniques about releasing yourself if someone grabs you and there were techniques about the most vulnerable [ways] to fight back if you were assaulted. I go from that, fast forward to many years later when I got to know Pauline Bart who was a very eloquent writer about rape and women fighting back. She did studies about women who were trained to or learned to fight back versus women who were trained to lie down and take it. I had heard always growing up that if youÃ¢Â€Â™re assaulted; youÃ¢Â€Â™re going to be killed if you fight back--until I took this class. 40 When I got to Pauline BartÃ¢Â€Â™s readings and then got to know her as a colleague and heard that there were actual data that the women who fought back, very often, got away and were not raped versus those who submitted were a hundred percent raped. There was no guarantee they werenÃ¢Â€Â™t going to be killed. It was an incredibly eye-opening experience. Marine-Street: IÃ¢Â€Â™ll say. LetÃ¢Â€Â™s take a quick break. Gartrell: [00:56:29] Okay. [End of Part 1 of 5 - Interview with Nanette Gartrell - August 29, 2018] 41 42 STANFORD UNIVERSITY PROJECT: STANFORD PIONEERING WOMEN ALUMNAE ORAL HISTORY PROJECT INTERVIEWEE: NANETTE GARTRELL INTERVIEWER: NATALIE MARINE-STREET DATE OF INTERVIEW: AUGUST 29, 2018 PART: 2 OF 5 Marine-Street: Before we move on, is there anything else youÃ¢Â€Â™d like to say about the selfdefense course? Gartrell: [00:00:06] One other thing that just came to mind is in Pauline BartÃ¢Â€Â™s research about lying down and taking it versus fighting back--and fighting back included using strategies to extract yourself. There were accounts that she provided of women who actually talked men who had weapons out of their weapons and then managed to escape without being assaulted. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s really quite phenomenal but not only did she find that if you do fight back or use a strategy to escape that you have a chance of not being sexually violated. But even if you were raped and you fought back, that the psychological sequelae for those who resisted versus those who didnÃ¢Â€Â™t was dramatically different. That is fascinating. That was always fascinating to me. The fighters ultimately did better than those who thought that they had to comply and didnÃ¢Â€Â™t try any strategies. Not that theyÃ¢Â€Â™re to be blamed-those who are to be blamed are the police and the men who told us, Ã¢Â€ÂœDonÃ¢Â€Â™t 43 resist, donÃ¢Â€Â™t resist.Ã¢Â€Âù They are to be blamed, and I have strong feelings about that. Reference 10 - 0.29% CoverageThat is an incredible thing. I mean here was a man who had the potential to use--he came from a very privileged background--his patriarchal power in a way that would be all about conformity, and he never was. [00:39:17] For him to choose to endorse and support a person who started out just as a lesbian and became a radical lesbian feminist with all that that entails, who took on the APA around sexual abuse of patients with all that that entails, and so many other things, is really an incredible statement about who he was.Reference 11 - 0.92% CoverageMy work related to sex abuse by physicians led to my decision to give a talk in I believe it was 1992 or 1993 at Women in Medicine on ethics and boundaries for lesbian physicians because we already knew from data that had been gathered that female-female cases were the second highest percentage of reported abuse cases. The majority were male physician/male therapist-female patient. Going way, way, way, way down in the percentages but the next highest category--thirteen percent of cases--were female-female. I knew of cases. They had come to my attention. They were just as abusive and just as damaging to the patient as any other case of abuse. I stood up in front of this group, and I talked about why we needed ethics codes and why we needed to be just as vigilant in our own community as we expect our male colleagues to be in the community of physicians. Then I gave case example after case example which were, I think, really eyeopening and horrifying to members of the audience. I was asked to repeat that [presentation] or do an updated version of that presentation this year. I was asked actually before the #MeToo movement started. The #MeToo 98 movement became the backdrop of the talk that I just presented a few weeks ago. When the Q&A happened at this talk, lesbian physician after lesbian physician stood up who had been there in the first talk and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœI remember when you gave your first talk. It was eye-opening for me. It changed the way I practiced. It changed the way I understood the dynamics of power abuse. One of the messages that youÃ¢Â€Â™ve said very clearly is that we, as women, very often think we donÃ¢Â€Â™t have the power to abuse but, in fact, we do. References 12-13 - 8.02% CoverageGartrell: [00:16:41] Yes, when I became chair of the Committee on Women, my understanding of the responsibility was--this was 1982--to advocate for womenÃ¢Â€Â™s mental health on a national basis. So that if there was a problem related to womenÃ¢Â€Â™s mental health, it was the responsibility of the Committee on Women to figure it out and do something about it. Very soon after I assumed the position, I heard that the number of malpractice claims filed against psychiatrists through the American Psychiatric AssociationÃ¢Â€Â™s insurance carrier --they had an insurance carrier at that time--based on allegations of sexual abuse of the patient, were skyrocketing. At that time, we were coming off the 1960s and 1970s, the free love era, [aka] anything goes. There were no ethics codes. There were no licensing board regulations. There were no laws about this. For me and for those on 102 my committee, it was a no-brainer. Your patients are not there for you to have sex with. Your patients come to you because they have psychological difficulties for which they need help. We started looking into this, and we were getting more and more information about this as a potential problem but by then, I was already quite wise to the fact that the APA was [laughter] an institution in which there was a tremendous amount of resistance to change and that it seemed unlikely that we could do anything about the problem that we were hearing about until we had evidence documenting it. I proposed that we put together a questionnaire, and get the APA to agree to send it out to all the psychiatrists in the country and do it in a neutral fashion because, again, there were no ethics codes, there were no laws, there were no licensing board regulations. With nothing in place saying itÃ¢Â€Â™s not a bad thing, you could just ask the questions in a neutral way and maybe people would answer the questions. Have you been sexually involved with a patient? If you have, how long did the relationship last? Is it still ongoing? Questions like that and then we got a little further into it. Have you been involved with more than one patient? How many patients have you been with and can you tell us how many patients youÃ¢Â€Â™ve been involved with? We put together this questionnaire. We submitted it through the channels, and we were stonewalled by committee after committee after committee that was responsible for approving projects like this. [We were] starting to get accusations like, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhat [are you] trying to do? [You are] going to destroy the credibility of the psychiatric profession.Ã¢Â€Âù We were going to destroy the credibility of the 103 psychiatric profession? To us, it seemed as though psychiatrists who were sexually abusing their patients were destroying the credibility of the psychiatric profession. We continued to push forward and said we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t agree and we wanted to do this survey and we wanted the APA to sponsor it. At a certain point, it became clear that it was re-cycling back through the same committees that had already rejected it. I had brought onto the Committee on Women, Judith Herman, whoÃ¢Â€Â™s my really good friend and colleague, and Silvia Olarte, another psychiatrist. There were other members of the committee who were very much in support of this project. [00:20:54] We decided we would give the APA a deadline. If they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t approve the project by this deadline, we would do the study ourselves independently. They actually didnÃ¢Â€Â™t imagine that I could get the mailing labels in order to send out the questionnaire to psychiatrists in the country because this was--again--before everyone had computers in their homes, and they owned the mailing labels for the Psychiatric Association. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know how they printed them out when they needed them--I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember whether they printed envelopes or labels or what they had. They just figured theyÃ¢Â€Â™d let the deadline pass and that it was a false statement on my part that I could actually do it independently. But what they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t know is while we were waiting for the deadline, first of all, IÃ¢Â€Â™d contacted two individuals at the Harvard School of Public Health about doing the statistics. And that continuing medical education was beginning to be a booming and profitable industry. So we were starting to get mailings about continuing medical 104 education courses. They were coming through the AMA. I was never a member of the AMA because--talk about organizations that were never progressive enough for me--that was certainly one of them! The AMA was located in Chicago. I contacted the Harvard Continuing Medical Education Office, and I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhen youÃ¢Â€Â™re sending out CME courses, how do you get your mailing labels? Do you have your own?Ã¢Â€Âù They said, Ã¢Â€ÂœNo, no, we get them through a clearinghouse through the AMA in Chicago.Ã¢Â€Âù And they gave me the number. I already had plans to conduct a course on ethics in medicine and in psychiatry and so I had already been kind of thinking along these lines. I contacted this clearinghouse, and I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™m a Harvard faculty member and IÃ¢Â€Â™m planning to do this course and how would I obtain mailing labels?Ã¢Â€Âù I [also asked], Ã¢Â€ÂœHow many do you have for psychiatrists?Ã¢Â€Âù I think they had 25,000 or something. I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœAnd how much would that cost?Ã¢Â€Âù It was very expensive. Every study that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve done, IÃ¢Â€Â™ve essentially funded myself out of my own earnings. I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, could you randomly select every fifth psychiatrist in the country, and how much would that cost?Ã¢Â€Âù And they said, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh yes, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not a problem.Ã¢Â€Âù That was several thousand dollars, but I was willing to pay for it. They said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWeÃ¢Â€Â™ll give them to you zip code sequenced, which, as it turned out, is a very big deal because when youÃ¢Â€Â™re taking things in bulk to the post office, which I did not know previously, you have to put them in bags [that are] zip code sequenced. I got all those arrangements made. The deadline came and passed. I contacted the clearinghouse. I got the labels 105 shipped to me; again, sitting on the floor--always I was seemingly [sitting] on hardwood floors stuffing envelopes after printing out questionnaires. [00:24:16] We had thankfully moved away from mimeograph into being able to have Xerox copies back then. [I spent days] stuffing these envelopes, putting stamps on them, getting them to the post office. We sent them out to every fifth psychiatrist in the country. Officials at the APA went ballistic when some of them received this questionnaire. They thought I had broken into the APA and stolen the labels, gotten into the office and stolen the labels! They had no idea that I could possibly do this without breaking in. I assured them that I had a plan to conduct a course based on the results of the study. They were just apoplectic about this. We got the questionnaires back. We also got some that said things like, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe believe you have secretly coded these questionnaires, and there is no circumstance in which I would fill it out because I believe you can identify us.Ã¢Â€Âù We received back a lot of obscenities and very hostile comments. Leaving aside the obscenities and the blank questionnaires that they sent back that we had to pay the postage on, of course, because they often stuffed them with heavy things so we had to pay more postage, we tabulated our results. Seven percent of psychiatrists acknowledged being sexually involved with their patients and a number of those had been involved with more than one patient. All our publications are available to be read so IÃ¢Â€Â™m not going to go into details of numbers. They can be downloaded also--many of them--on our study websites. We then had the issue of publishing the article. The preeminent journal of psychiatry is the American Psychiatric 106 AssociationÃ¢Â€Â™s journal, the American Journal of Psychiatry. The editor of that journal was none other than my department chair who wanted me not to use my hospital affiliation and my Harvard affiliation on any of my publications. They did not have anonymous review, of course. One of the things IÃ¢Â€Â™d worked on for years was to get medical journals to have anonymous review because all the data that we had showed that if even a single woman was a co-author, the chance of an article being accepted was reduced. We wrote up the first paper and submitted it to the American Journal of Psychiatry. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s standard to send out a manuscript to two reviewers, sometimes three reviewers. He sent it out to seven simultaneous reviewers. We got seven pages-long criticisms of us--not of the study--nothing about the analysis or anything about the legitimacy of the actual research itself. We sat down and typed up [our responses], dutifully responding to every criticism. The one that was most entertaining to us--Ã¢Â€ÂœThese data could not possibly be accurate. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s no way that they could be accurate.Ã¢Â€Âù To that one, we responded, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe completely agree with you. These data are not accurate. They canÃ¢Â€Â™t even begin to be accurate because they inevitably underrepresent the prevalence of this abuse.Ã¢Â€Âù They werenÃ¢Â€Â™t prepared for that [laughter]. My final statement in our very long, many-page response to these criticisms [that was sent] back to the editor of the journal who happened to be my department chair was, Ã¢Â€ÂœWe understand if the reviewers and you make a decision that you do not want to publish it, but itÃ¢Â€Â™s important to let you know that the American Psychological AssociationÃ¢Â€Â™s journal has expressed an interest in publishing this article.Ã¢Â€Âù Which [would] essentially [be] letting the 107 competitor put out the information about psychiatry. I mean, I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t say that but that was obvious. Very reluctantly it was published [in the American Journal of Psychiatry]. [00:28:57] We then did a number of follow-up studies including studying senior residents--all senior residents--in terms of their sexual involvement with patients and already there were some who were sexually involved with patients. I heard endlessly from psychiatrists, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhy donÃ¢Â€Â™t you survey the other specialties? OB/GYNs, surgeons, family practitioners, internists? Surely theyÃ¢Â€Â™re sexually involved with patients too,Ã¢Â€Âù as if that justified aything. When I [joined the UCSF faculty], I gathered colleagues in other fields and, in fact, we did that study too. And, in fact, found [that], yes, indeed, [physicians in other specialties were abusing patients too]. Also from their own assessment of the impact on patients who had been sexually involved with non-psychiatric physicians whom they knew of, that the consequences were always damaging to the patients. We knew from data we had been gathering over the [prior] decade that most patients who were abused by psychiatrists [or other mental health professionals] ended up severely depressed when the relationships terminated, which they did inevitably. Ten percent were psychiatrically hospitalized and one percent committed suicide. We even had people write in things on their questionnaires like, Ã¢Â€ÂœYou know, IÃ¢Â€Â™m not really sure that this involvement is worth the effort. This patient was terribly dysfunctional to begin with and things just got worse after the sexual involvement so IÃ¢Â€Â™m not really sure that this is something that IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to continue.Ã¢Â€Âù This is what we 108 were dealing with. The point of all of this was we had a mission, a mission to establish ethics codes, to have licensing board regulations that made it very clear that sexual involvement with any patient was unacceptable. Our mission [encompassed] any current or former patient. We donÃ¢Â€Â™t have that in all the regulations, but it has also become a felony in many states. And there are reporting regulations in some states that if you, as a medical professional, hear of another colleague who is involved with a patient, however you hear about it, youÃ¢Â€Â™re required to report it to the licensing board. We have had a great impact in terms of change. It was a hard-fought battle and a really important one from my perspective, in thinking about the vast number of patients who were severely damaged--[creating] what we call an iatrogenic problem--caused by a medical intervention, which [in this case] was an abuse. Marine-Street: ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s just incredible to me that it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t part of the code of ethics. When did it finally get into the code of ethics? Do you know? Gartrell: [00:32:00] There were a lot of different changes to the ethics codes, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s now in the AMA Codes of Ethics. It wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t part of academic codes of ethics-faculty/students--either. This is all the result of the work that we did in this area [first in] psychiatry and then [in] medicine that it became something that was then [considered] in academia [concerning] faculty and students. I mean, you know, the whole concept of Ã¢Â€ÂœtheyÃ¢Â€Â™re both adults, itÃ¢Â€Â™s freedom of choice, itÃ¢Â€Â™s a consensual relationshipÃ¢Â€Âù--in medicine, we know what informed consent means and I have said this very clearly since I began this work. Informed consent means you explain the risks and benefits of any [proposed treatment 109 or intervention]. I can assure you thereÃ¢Â€Â™s never been an abusing physician who has explained that Ã¢Â€Âœyou have a fifty percent chance of a severe depression, ten percent chance of psychiatric hospitalization, one percent chance of committing suicide as a result of this--your imminent sexual involvement with me. [So] letÃ¢Â€Â™s go meet at the Holiday Inn.Ã¢Â€Âù I mean, does that sound likely? No. Faculty/student involvement, I mean, [itÃ¢Â€Â™s important to think about] who [holds the power]. WeÃ¢Â€Â™ve talked about the all-male or predominately male academic institutions in which I grew up. Many of those individuals themselves likely were either aware of or themselves participating in the abuse of power that we [now] know was rampant. Marine-Street: Just the fact that someone would actually be truthful on the questionnaire and return it to you would seem to indicate that there was some degree of acceptance. Gartrell: [00:34:07] Acceptance because we were just coming off the free love movement when it was [considered] okay. In fact, when I was at Stanford, for classmates who got involved with faculty members, that was a badge of honor for them because what did they get out of it? They had a ticket to opportunity, for a time. Marine-Street: Was that frequent when you were at Stanford? Gartrell: [00:34:35] I know of circumstances. Frequency--I would not be surprised if it were frequent, but my mission was to get us out of the DSM back then.References 14-17 - 5.63% Coverage Gartrell: [00:36:25] Yes. When I was a senior resident at Harvard, I spent half of my time at Harvard Student Health Services. IÃ¢Â€Â™d only seen very, very, very mentally ill patients [in my residency education at the state hospital]. I was interested in working with healthy lesbian and gay people and helping them with their [internalized] homophobia. Having a lot of expertise in how to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder and so on really wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t going to be helpful to me in terms of dealing with healthier people with run-of-the-mill problems. I wanted to work with healthier people. I applied for and was accepted for doing part of my senior residency at Harvard Student Health Services. My supervisor there was Paul Walters. It became clear to me that he was doing something that wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t okay while I was there. This was 1979. He was an analyst. He had a sofa in his office. It was a dark blue sofa. It had stains all over it. For supervision I met in there. I sat in the chair and when all the residents met in there, we sat all around. I always was trying to get the chair rather than the sofa. [I noticed that when he saw] patients, they seemed to stay for a very long period of time. It just felt creepy. Those were my observations. I started doing the research on sex abuse by psychiatrists. We had two people from Harvard School of Public Health whom we were working with, and through other people at the Harvard School of Public Health and my networking around Harvard, I met some people who worked at the Harvard Risk Management Foundation. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know if thatÃ¢Â€Â™s a concept that is familiar to people, in general, so IÃ¢Â€Â™ll just say something about it. Basically, they managed the malpractice claims that came 111 in against Harvard doctors, which meant they shoved them under the rug as much as possible or did payoffs that were private or confidential because nobody wanted bad publicity against Harvard doctors. [00:39:23] I heard from somebody I really trusted, who was a really straight arrow person who worked with the Risk Management Foundation, that a claim had come in against Paul Walters for sexually abusing a Harvard student, having her pay him thirty-five dollars a session, I think it was, for oral sex three times a week as therapy, [and it had somehow been Ã¢Â€Âœtaken care ofÃ¢Â€Âù by the Risk Management Foundation]. I was already working on sex abuse. That individual said to me, Ã¢Â€ÂœIf this comes to your attention in any other wayÃ¢Â€Âù--because this was a breaking of a confidence as a person working with the Risk Management Foundation--Ã¢Â€Âœyou need to pursue it.Ã¢Â€Âù Before I left Harvard, I still had some friends who were on the staff at [Harvard Student] Mental Health Services where he still was. I said to them, Ã¢Â€ÂœIf you hear anything about Paul Walters behaving sexually inappropriately with students, you need to let me know.Ã¢Â€Âù Before I left Harvard to move to California in 1987, he called me. Paul Walters, out of the blue. I had had no contact with him since 1979. Oh, [actually] I had. [Colleagues and I] had done a presentation at the American Psychiatric Association on sexual abuse of patients after we had published the first paper. He was there sitting in the front row. There were a whole collection of people [in that row]. I recognized him, but there were others that none of us recognized sitting in the first row of this huge auditorium. He called me after that and he said he wanted to let me know that he was leaving 112 his position at Harvard, and he was moving to California. Where? To Stanford to become the director of Cowell Student Health Services. I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœOh, well, why are you telling me?Ã¢Â€Âù He said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, when I was out there, I mentioned that I knew you and that you were one of my supervisees and that you went to Stanford.Ã¢Â€Âù Now my work had already been publicized in a big way. I mean, front page stories in the Boston Globe, the sex abuse stuff--the results of the findings. It was clear he had used me in some kind of deceitful way to help get a position at Cowell Student Health Services. I left Harvard. Moved out here. The first year I was here, I got a call from one of the social workers who was still on the faculty at Harvard [Student Health] saying they got an anonymous letter from a woman who made the same claims--$35 an hour, da da da da da. I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœThank you very much. IÃ¢Â€Â™m filing a complaint with the Massachusetts Licensing Board and the California Licensing Board. IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to inform them.Ã¢Â€Âù So I did. Both began a major investigation. The story became front page news out here and in Massachusetts. He left his position at Cowell Student Health Services. He claimed that he had a substance abuse problem, and he tried to get into a diversion program which, if you get in a diversion program, they drop all charges against you--itÃ¢Â€Â™s a nifty, sneaky loophole for perpetrators. Somehow there was enough publicity around it that they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t allow him into it. He went underground and was never found again. Every few years I got a call from a San Jose Mercury news reporter who was trying to find him; [the reporter] was pretty convinced that [Walters, who] was from North 113 Carolina, had gone back [there] and changed his name and was working [there]. I actually was very fearful that my name would come out as the person who reported him to the licensing board. All I had done [was to say], Ã¢Â€ÂœThis has come to my attention. Please investigate and please contact the Harvard Risk Management Foundation and make sure you start your investigation there.Ã¢Â€Âù [00:44:40] When they did, the risk management people I guess were obligated to contact Patient A who then said, Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™m willing to be named,Ã¢Â€Âù which was amazing. So I was never publicly [named] on any of the press about it, which I was very grateful about because I was afraid he was going to come [after me and] kill me--literally. I was afraid because we already knew that psychiatrists who took care of patients whoÃ¢Â€Â™d been abused--women psychiatrists who took care of patients who had been abused--these were colleagues and friends of mine--had their offices broken into, their offices vandalized, and their records stolen because they were encouraging and supporting these women in filing complaints. The perpetrators were trying to stop the complaints from happening by attacking the subsequent treating women psychiatrists. These were scary times. I was afraid that this guy whose misdeeds I had reported, [resulting in a huge] impact on his career, was going to come after me. Fortunately, I was not [named] by the media but the Patient A contacted me and said, Ã¢Â€ÂœI donÃ¢Â€Â™t know how you found out but itÃ¢Â€Â™s [been] life-changing for me that you did--in a positive way--and I want to thank you so much for [having done] this.Ã¢Â€Âù When it was publicized in Boston, [she was] Patient A, [and subsequently] 114 Patient B, [and] Patient C [and] I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know how many [others] came forward and were willing to be named on the complaint. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s one horror story. Another is the psychiatrist that my mother saw from the time she was psychiatrically hospitalized and for the next twenty-some years. He was a really creepy guy in Santa Barbara. He too became very prominent in psychiatry. He was president of the [World Association of Social Psychiatry]. His name was John Carleton. I sat outside the waiting room when she had appointments sometimes. As a teenager when I met him, he took my hand. He wanted to show me around the offices, and he kind of fondled my hand in a way that felt totally, totally crepy. I was a teenager who was already afraid of inappropriate behavior by men. I wanted to get my hand away, and he was fondling my hand so I was completely creeped out by this guy. I ran into him at some APA meetings, one of which when I was a resident. He got into an elevator and I was standing there with my residency training director at Harvard, and [Carleton] turned to me and he said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWell, hi, Nanette. How nice to see you. Your mother told me to say hello.Ã¢Â€Âù My mother was his patient. That is the most inappropriate thing in the world to say. That is a total breach of confidentiality. I walk out of the elevator, and my residency training director said, Ã¢Â€ÂœWho is he?Ã¢Â€Âù I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœMy motherÃ¢Â€Â™s psychiatrist.Ã¢Â€Âù I mean, totally embarrassing to me that that had happened. IÃ¢Â€Â™d been doing [sex abuse] research. I was already out here. My mother called me a few years after I [moved to San Francisco]. It actually was in the early 1990s. I was working on a big fundraiser for our lesbian health services here 115 in San Francisco, and I had created an idea of a fundraiser that was really successful. I was driving back across the Golden Gate Bridge. It was a time when we had a car phone, and she called me. I said, Ã¢Â€ÂœI really canÃ¢Â€Â™t talk right now. IÃ¢Â€Â™m on the bridge.Ã¢Â€Âù She said, Ã¢Â€ÂœI have something I have to tell you. I know youÃ¢Â€Â™ve been doing all this work all this time [meaning, on sexual abuse] and I know that you never liked Dr. Carleton.Ã¢Â€Âù She wanted to tell me--she felt like she had to tell me--that she had been sexually involved with him and when she told him that the relationship needed to stop, he had raped her. She also said, Ã¢Â€ÂœHe also encouraged me to kill your father.Ã¢Â€Âù I was just horrified at all this. Ã¢Â€ÂœHe encouraged me when we went out sailing to push him overboard. That was before he raped me, before I told him I canÃ¢Â€Â™t keep seeing him.Ã¢Â€Âù [00:49:42] I contacted the California Licensing Board. He had meanwhile married a patient. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know how many patients he--I think there were stories of multiple patients--I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know how many he married, but he married at least one. The only thing I could think of to do was to contact, again, the California Licensing Board, and I sent them this complaint. I asked my mother if sheÃ¢Â€Â™d be willing to be named on the complaint. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t remember the circumstances exactly. She had gone through this complicated decision-making process but I said to them, Ã¢Â€ÂœYouÃ¢Â€Â™ve got to open a file on him. If you get any other complaints, you really need to do something about it.Ã¢Â€ÂùReference 18 - 1.05% CoverageGartrell: [00:23:53] I guess I would say that my entire career has been one in which the personal is the political. Even most recently, the great fear that a person who demonstrates signs of mental instability has access to the nuclear codes made it very clear that there was great urgency to try to protect the planet. But long before that, my goals were to make this world a better and safer place and provide civil rights for LGBT people. That has been a mission throughout my career and will continue to be. [My sex abuse work became a parallel track]--also more than a decadeÃ¢Â€Â™s worth of work--because I just happened to fall into some knowledge about [physician] abuse of patients and power abuse. That [line of work] became a very big theme in my life. And it recurs now as weÃ¢Â€Â™re in the #MeToo movement. [All around us] we see the 129 incredibly positive changes that are occurring as women are speaking out about abuse. My interview began with your questions about my experiences of abuse as a child. At one point you asked how did I get through those experiences and manage to keep on going. I have to say that I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think anybody who has gone through abuse could probably answer the question of why we made it to the next step other than at first, weÃ¢Â€Â™re [just] trying to survive. And then [of course itÃ¢Â€Â™s incredibly fortunate] if we can garner resources, [perhaps] have the privilege and the good fortune of having something like a Stanford education with access to really smart and talented people, and [then take a] look around at movement activists who have the strength and [talent to] create communities to make changes and work for social justice. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve had the privilege of knowing amazing community activists who have created phenomenal change and [forged] paths to so much social justice in our world. I have simply been trying to do my part in the dimensions that are within my area of expertise<Files\\SHSA\\SHSA_Gianturco_Paola> - § 2 references coded  [1.35% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.69% CoverageThe first story was actually about a group started by a high school English teacher [Betty Makoni] in Zimbabwe who started an organization called the Girls Empowerment Network. Betty had been listening to the stories that her high school students-87 her English students--were telling her and she discovered that the medicine women in their culture were telling HIV-positive men that they would be cured if they had sex with virgins. The men were having sex with--they were raping--these teenage girls, who were, of course, then HIV-positive. Betty Makoni decided that she would organize these girls and help them understand what was going on, how to avoid it, how they could help each other, how they could come to each other's aid, and so forth. [00:24:02] The first photograph is these girls at their board meeting. I went to the board meeting expecting to see teachers and social workers. No. Girls! [laughs] This [NGO actually inspired my idea of doing a book about groups of activist] girlsReference 2 - 0.66% CoverageGianturco: I'll tell you about Wonder Girls. Well, what can I tell you about Wonder Girls? As far as I can tell, there are no other books that document the work of groups of activist girls. There are books about individual activists like Malala. But I was seeing, as early as 2007, girls in Zimbabwe who began a girls movement in their country. They made child rape a national issue using an interesting tool. [00:47:08] Remember, [the Girls' Empowerment Network] was started by a high school English teacher. Those girls use poetry, which they write about their own experiences and recite in public. As soon as they do, [snaps fingers] their communities are mobilized to action against the men who rape girls. I've been interested for a long time in what groups of girls can do, even groups of very young girls. I was particularly interested in the age group from ten to eighteen. The UN says you're no longer a girl after eighteen. You're a woman. So Wonder Girls<Files\\SHSF\\SHSF_Gelpi_Barbara> - § 1 reference coded  [0.33% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.33% Coverage All this had happened in the years before, and we were still trying to take that in. [00:53:18] At one point when there was a rape in the dorm, a young woman had just gotten raped, Al came in the morning to tell me about that. I said, "Al, I don't understand. I don't believe it. Truly, this isn't possible. He said, "Barbara, the fabric of society is coming apart."ù He was right, it was very bad, and we didn't have the training or the experience to deal with it properly. <Files\\SHSF\\SHSF_Kraemer_Helena> - § 2 references coded  [5.55% Coverage]References 1-2 - 5.55% CoverageKraemer: [01:02:08] I think the one that I am most conscious of was the establishment of an office where sexual harassment was actually documented and the documentation was kept. The reason for this goes back to the time when I was working with David Hamburg at the outdoor primate facility. There were several research assistants there who were, they reported, molested by one of the psychiatry department members--not David, obviously. I wonÃ¢Â€Â™t mention this personÃ¢Â€Â™s name, (heÃ¢Â€Â™s long gone by now). Anyway, it was a legitimate complaint. What 49 they were reporting was real molestation. This was not simply harassment or Ã¢Â€Âœhe says, she saysÃ¢Â€Âù kinds of things -- unless they were lying, which it turned out they werenÃ¢Â€Â™t. Because there were so few women faculty members, the reported incidents landed on my desk. [01:03:18] I was assistant professor at the time, which meant that this shouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t have landed on my desk at all. I went to the chairman of the department once I ascertained that this was really a true report. These three girls were extremely upset and all they wanted to have happen was for the molestation to stop. They didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want the psychiatry department member punished, they didnÃ¢Â€Â™t want anything else. They wanted the molestation to stop. I reported to the chairman of the department, Tom Gonda, who fundamentally said, Ã¢Â€ÂœBoys will be boys.Ã¢Â€Âù [01:03:53] Those are actually his words. I then took the matter to Herant Katchadourian, then the ombudsman of the university. He took it to the dean, Miller at the time. I thought they handled it wonderfully well. They asked this faculty member to write an undated letter of resignation and sign it and told him that if this ever happened again, even one more incident of this type, they would simply accept his resignation at that point in time. Things cooled off for the next few years. [01:04:31] The problem was that when an incident of this sort happened again, some fifteen or twenty years later, there was no record of the earlier incident. The woman involved decided to sue Stanford. Tobey: Was this the same man? 50 Kraemer: [01:04:46] Same man. She was his research assistant. She decided to sue, and her lawyer made it clear that unless there had been some knowledge by the university that this was going on, Stanford could not be sued. She could sue him, but she couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t sue Stanford. The question then was: Had Stanford any knowledge of any untoward activities by this man? By this time, there was a different president of the university, a different provost, a different dean, a different chairman. Everything was different. [01:05:20] Nobody officially remembered the previous incidents at all. The lawyer went to Frances Conley and said. Ã¢Â€ÂœDo you know of anything?Ã¢Â€Âù Frances said, Ã¢Â€ÂœIf anybody knows, itÃ¢Â€Â™s going to be Helen.Ã¢Â€Âù I had all the documentation and gave it to the lawyer. I thought that was only fair. But the letter of resignation was gone, so the wonderful solution all those years before had just disappeared. The suit was finally settled. The faculty member resigned and left the university, and he died a few years ago. The matter was settled. [01:06:01] Institutional memory is important in situations of this kind. They should have kept an eye on him all those years. The kind of behaviors that he was reported to have engaged in with these girls were not subtle, and in absence of oversight, he was going to repeat. Just ignoring such a situation was really bad.<Files\\SHSF\\SHSF_Litt_Iris> - § 1 reference coded  [0.63% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.63% CoverageI remember I had a group of four students, or were there six? Anyway, half of them were women and half were men. On one particular day, the men were not there, just happened, illness or whatever, and the women began talking about sexual abuse, their own, and that surely never would have come up if I had been a man. <Files\\SHSF\\SHSF_Martin_Joanne> - § 1 reference coded  [3.18% Coverage]Reference 1 - 3.18% CoverageSometimes a woman I didn't know needed advice on something, sometimes a woman who had been raped or harassed sexually, a faculty woman, and sometimes just a friend or a friend of a friend. Tracy: Since you mentioned sexual harassment, in the mid 1990s, the sexual harassment policy went through some revisions. There were a lot of questions around liability and confidentiality. Do you have a memory of that policy being revised in the mid 1990s, or your sense of the problem? Because obviously you were hearing about--. Martin: [01:51:25] When I was the only woman faculty in the GSB--. If you were raped in the Business School -- student, faculty - -who would you come to on the faculty? So I did a lot of that kind of counseling then. The university ombudsman put complaints about certain faculty "in the drawer."ù There were complaints about some people over the years that were never acted on. The actual policy arguments were something I spoke up about in the faculty senate, but I wasn't a primary person on that. Tracy: Considering your position and being one of the only women, what was your sense of how prevalent sexual assault and sexual harassment were? Did you see a change in that over the years? 65 Martin: [01:52:34] When I came I was really visible because I was the only one in the Business School. People came to me from all over campus, freshmen even, in tears, "I was a virgin. I got raped."ù Over time, the university began to respond on the undergraduate level by having a widespread network of people who did that kind of counseling. I was very glad to get out of that business. At the doctoral and postdoctoral and the faculty level, the retaliation and repercussions of complaining are really career-sensitive, particularly if you came to Stanford to work with one person in a very narrow field, and that person's going to be writing your recommendations until the day he dies. Saying no to some of those people, they immediately would withdraw support from you. An offer to talk on a panel at a conference or contribute a chapter to a book suddenly disappears. It's a hint that you better find someone else to write your letter of recommendation. Whether you're going to actually take that complaint up through the university hierarchy when that person's been doing this for years and has always gotten away with it, that's a very tough decision for a victim, and I found it awkward. I don't want to talk about this much more because every time someone comes to you, you're supposed to report it to the administration. Someof those cases, they would never have talked to me if they thought I would report it. They really needed to talk to somebody. I didn't have pat answers because those people are damned if they do and damned if they don't. We could talk more about what if this, and what if that, but like any good counselor, I wouldn't tell someone what to do in a situation like that. I've been actively involved in that. By the time the policy 66 came through I spoke up, and I spoke up in the senate, and I think it had an effect on some issues. Over time, the most important aspects of that policy did get revised, sometimes better, sometimes worse. I was just one of many at that point.<Files\\SHSF\\SHSF_Miner_Anne> - § 1 reference coded  [0.70% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.70% Coverage Another weird happy one, which maybe is not so good to end on, but itÃ¢Â€Â™s going to be interesting, I believe, is we didnÃ¢Â€Â™t talk a lot about this, but thereÃ¢Â€Â™s the sexual harassment, sex issue, the climate of the relationships of men and women in terms of sexuality and saying yes or no and all that sort of thing. We talked about the steamfitters putting the naked picture up in the steam plant. But this current issue in higher education of the women students and theyÃ¢Â€Â™re complaining about men, mostly undergraduates, right, what does 197 it mean to say no, and are the women students protected enough from the predatory male undergraduate, is a very tough problem. I think that itÃ¢Â€Â™s a sign of another turn of the wheel in terms of the level of sophistication weÃ¢Â€Â™ll finally get to about power and sex and these sex roles, and why was it this kind of a male who persists--so I find that hopeful, not because it will be a simple solution but to solve it, which I think will happen. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think it was solved even back then. We didnÃ¢Â€Â™t even understand how bad it was, probably. I think thatÃ¢Â€Â™ll be a good thing in terms of womenÃ¢Â€Â™s power--I was involved in an undergraduate dorm for several years recently, and they did training, they did skits on what does it mean to say no. Devaney: YouÃ¢Â€Â™re talking about student behavior. Miner: [01:45:17] Sex--with each other, just with each other. They run seminars in dorms, and we have very serious efforts to solve these things. They have a skit and itÃ¢Â€Â™s about if the woman says no, does she mean no, is that just a way to flirt. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s good because the women are learning from this whole issue. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s donÃ¢Â€Â™t blame the victim, but on the other hand, shouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t I have some role in taking care of myself. The men are learning. Some of these men are not coming from sophisticated environments, they really never have thought about the problem that a drunk woman saying nothing is not the same as yes. I think, actually, all that will replay and touch deeper on the link between gender and power in ways that will be healthy for everybody. <Files\\SHSF\\SHSF_Tversky_Barbara> - § 1 reference coded  [0.13% Coverage]Reference 1 - 0.13% Coverage Psychoanalysis is years of individual therapy.

But, I think what it was was raising concerns and feelings about issues that I wasn&#8217;t sure I really wanted raised at that point. And, that&#8217;s why I went off and tried other groups because I was a little nervous about raising some of these feelings, and I was probably right about them. The problem is that once you start having concerns and awareness of problems then there&#8217;s no going back, and that&#8217;s pretty much what was going on. Once you learn&#8212;I don&#8217;t want to call it oppression because I can&#8217;t stand that whole mind set, but once you learn, become sensitive to, or whatever else you want to call it, the whole set of issues it&#8217;s hard not to let them take over. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve actually succeeded along those lines. I&#8217;ve always been since then very sensitive about women being treated differently, just like a lot of blacks feel the same way about being treated as blacks, and I can understand that. Because we are treated differently, and there&#8217;s always this, &#8220;Did they really mean to do it, or is it sort of a subconscious or just totally not even there?&#8221; And you&#8217;re always, after you start becoming aware of this, you start having to then figure out do they really mean that comment? And I&#8217;m not terribly good a subtleties, so you know, reading between the lines type thing. It takes me a long time to figure things out.References 3-4 - 2.01% CoverageWe want these women to become leaders. Marian McLawhorn beat this guy in Greenville. She&#8217;s from Greenville.

You'd have to sign up for a shift after you got some training. There'd be some staff who had a degree in counseling, and they could be backup in case there was a serious situation that was developing, someone was suicidal or had been raped. For me, it was a very good way to be introduced to the community, because I found out about all these agencies, like the Rape Crisis Center, and also what we didn't have at that point, which was something for battered women. That just wasn't there. It was a good introduction into that whole world of people who shared the same political views regarding women's health issues.Reference 2 - 3.73% CoverageEB: It was before then. We both might want to check in the history book. But when I was at the women's health counseling service -- and I mentioned to you it was this underground -- I became a volunteer and then I became the first director of the Women's Health Counseling Service. We applied for and were able to get some funding, Elaine Barney 12 so that I was actually hired to work. I had income, it was like "Ooh, this is nice!" after years of doing volunteer work. From that, then, I think the Rape Crisis Center had been formed earlier than that. Someone you might want to speak to about that would be -- JD: Miriam Slifkin? EB: Yes, thank you. Miriam Slifkin. The donor who I think has now gone public, in fact I know she has, her name was Swanna Cameron. She called Miriam and said she'd got money from her family -- it was Coca-Cola stock -- but no one had the 501c3 except Women's Health Counseling Service. Miriam said, "Why not talk to all three of us?" So we did. We talked about each of the agencies, what we represented, and she agreed to do this. Since Women's Health Counseling had the 501c3 we applied for it as a non-profit agency, got that together. Then we met for about a year ago in one of the places, I think it was the Coalition for Battered Women at that point. It was Durham-based but we were also trying to establish part of that in Chapel Hill. It was like auditioning for someone. We didn't know what to expect from Swanna, what questions she would ask or anything, but I think Miriam Slifkin set the tone and [it] really worked out well. She understood that there were different pieces to providing the services for women in Orange County. Then we were able to get the funding for it and then quickly established bylaws and all those god-awful rules and regulations.Reference 3 - 2.11% Coverage That united the three of the agencies, saying "Well, actually, I think that we need to remain separate." The majority of the county Elaine Barney 17 commissioners were men, and sometimes they couldn't grasp the fact that a Rape Crisis Center would be very different from a Women's Health Counseling Service, which would be very different from the Coalition for Battered Women. It was like, "But you're all women and you're all talking about it, so why not just put it all together?" and it's like, &#8220;Doesn't work that way.&#8221; Because everyone each had a piece of it, we knew what we wanted in each of the agencies. How to ensure that the general public understood that was going to take some doing. That's where we spent a lot of time. And understanding that yeah, Women's Health Counseling Service doesn't have the same financial needs that perhaps the Rape Crisis Center, or the Coalition for Battered Women, would have. But it also had certain needs that weren't being met, but we needed the money for them.<Files\\UNCGAS\\UNCGAS_FisherBorne_Marcie> - § 1 reference coded  [2.33% Coverage]Reference 1 - 2.33% Coverage We did a lot in terms of take back the night, sexual assault, were really involved with the rape crisis group, the battered women's program in the area, and the YWCA.

She was the one who went over with Dr. Lough to Bon Air and made contact with Virginia's reform school for girls, "State Industrial School for Girls." Florence was the one who followed up on that. Now, our experience there was to me a very interesting thing. It was the first concrete evidence that I had ever had, that if you believed in 34 people and gave them an opportunity, they would change, that they had it in them to change. Before that I had been thought of, at least around home, that I was too idealistic, that I was like Don Quixote fighting windmills, and so on. These girls at the Farm were taken off the streets in Norfolk and all over Virginia, but the Norfolk area was the one that I knew. They had been either five-and-ten-cent store girls or waitresses, and their pay was ridiculously low. And of course, especially as waitresses, they were exposed to sailors and everybody coming in who wanted to take advantage and have brief affairs. So a lot of these girls did. With some of them, it had happened in their own families. The uncle or their stepfather had raped these girls, and that had started them this way. Anyway, the situation was very terrible up there at the Virginia Reform School. They had a woman in charge who was unbelievable. She said that the girls were wicked; they should have no contact with each other, because all they could do was contaminate each other. So she didn't allow them to talk, at least not visit with each other. They had work brigades, kitchen, barnyard. This "reform school" is at Bon Air, Virginia. It is still there, as far as I know.<Files\\UNCSW\\UNCSW_Ransdall_Hollace> - § 1 reference coded  [3.48% Coverage]Reference 1 - 3.48% CoverageSo this inconsistency and this treating me as though I was a dangerous criminal and at the same time. . . this conflict.

And they called him out and said a little girl, that was maybe going home from school that afternoon, went on a trail through the woods. And when she got home she told her father that a black man, or surely a black "boy", you know, a black "boy" had followed her on the trail. That is, he had walked behind her, some distance behind her. He might not have been following her. After all, he didn't molest her, didn't touch her, and didn't say anything to her. Well, the father got all upset. That's what happened. I found that out later. But this was the tale that was going the night before. So what happened was that the father alerted all the men in the community, so they got a big posse out in the woods, and they finally found the so-called follower, the "boy", who had followed this little girl. And they just took him out the next morning, out on the hillside by the woods, hanged him to a limb and shot him to death. I mean, it was just as simple as that. That's the kind of lynching that happened thousands of times, I'm sure.

Police patrolled the street in front of the cottage and banged on our door at all hours of the night "to use the phone."

One of the jobs of Helpline volunteers was we served as the first response crisis contact for the Orange County Rape Crisis Center. And for what then was the Orange-Durham Coalition for Battered Women. And so I think of that as my first introduction to the rape crisis center. I&#8217;m sure I knew about it in various ways when I was an undergraduate student. But that was my first time contributing somehow to the mission of the center. And it was also my introduction to crisis intervention as something that I really liked being involved in. So after a bit of time being a Helpline volunteer, I ended up going to law school, and I kept doing that volunteer work, and I had been doing it long enough at that point that they invited me to be one of the trainers for the volunteer classes. It was still a volunteer position but I felt like I was more part of that work. So that was my introduction to actually participating in the kind of really excellent volunteer training that I think Orange County Rape Crisis Center still does. Reference 2 - 10.76% Coverage I came back to a job as Assistant Dean of Students and Judicial Programs Officer at UNC Chapel Hill, which was really a huge dream job for me. And part of my job there was going to be training student leaders around how to handle hearings, disciplinary hearings and those kinds of things. Part of it was sexual assault issues and helping to do compassionate appropriate response to students who were survivors of sexual violence and also helping to draft and administer policies around sexual violence. So there had been a lot of controversy on campus around sexual violence at that time or soon before I started. So the issues for the Committee on Student Conduct and some other initiatives that I was involved in really did focus a lot on sexual violence, and in that role within my first year I had been to the Orange County Rape Crisis Center several times because I really wanted to build that relationship with the university. So I would go to the Rape Crisis Center and participate in the volunteer trainings and talk about the university&#8217;s response, help prepare the rape crisis companions, how, what they might expect if they were helping a survivor through the university discipline processes or other ways the university could support survivors. And that was a really important part of my job. I also was one of the people at UNC that would greet survivors of sexual assault and help them determine what their options were and--. So then seven years into that I was Associate Dean of Students and Judicial Officer. And I had a chance, the Dean of Students had retired, and I had a chance to partially fill in that role for about a year, a year and a half, and I reached a point where I thought I was ready to transition into something different. I had been on one or two non-profit boards and I decided that I was going to consider non-profit management, and I started telling my friends, &#8220;Oh I would really like to work somewhere in non-profit management, maybe somewhere like the Orange County Rape Crisis Center.&#8221; So I started quietly telling friends that, just for more of a long-term plan. I wasn&#8217;t thinking of it as short term. I remember telling one of my best friends, &#8220;oh and I&#8217;m going to talk to Margaret Henderson who&#8217;s the director of Rape Crisis Center and see if I could ever maybe shadow her sometime and see what she does or maybe do even an internship there or something.&#8221; And lo and behold, about a week after I start saying all this Margaret Henderson announced she was leaving. And I saw it literally in the paper, which was really strange. And I thought, &#8220;Oh no, now this is something I have to think about and consider a little bit more quickly because obviously I had been very drawn to the work and to the organization and to non-profit work.&#8221; And then all of a sudden there&#8217;s that opportunity there that I really was not--, not necessarily prepared for all aspects of it. I had not had a lot of fundraising or development experience. I had not had huge amounts of financial management experience. But I had been immersed in the issues around sexual violence, and I had done a lot of volunteer training and a lot of work with clients and survivors of sexual violence, and I knew the community and I was part of the system that cared for sexual violence survivors. So there was a big piece of it that I felt real confident about and then there was a big piece of it that I was less certain. And I remember they had a really intense interview process. I had to come and meet with three different groups during that summer, and I remember how supportive Margaret Henderson was when I told her that I was applying, and I&#8217;m sure she was probably supportive to everyone who was involved in it if there were other candidates. So after the intensive interview process where I had to write an essay or something--I think the essay was to tell people why I was interested in the job--I ended up getting the job. So that was how my career at the Orange County Rape Crisis Center began.Reference 3 - 0.86% CoverageThat was not something people talked about at the university, a culture of self-care. It was more work all the time and that&#8217;s okay. At the Rape Crisis Center it was this idea that you need to take care of yourself in order to be healthy to help care for survivors or the community. So we really tried to work on that. Reference 4 - 4.46% CoverageMB: I should say that I, we had an incredible Dean of Students Fred Schroeder, and then Melissa Exum for my last year was the Dean of Students. Then there were always other Assistant Deans of Students. There was Sibby Anderson-Thompkins and Michelle Cofield and Ron Binder did Greek Affairs and Judy Barter before Ron Binder, so there were a lot of people in the Dean of Students office. There was also a Sexual Harassment officer who did more of that Title IX because that was more the staff and faculty. So we networked a lot with that office. So yeah, I wasn&#8217;t doing everything they are doing. I mean they&#8217;ve expanded. Thankfully they have expanded the Dean of Students&#8217; office staff, and they have more staff than they had when we were there. But it wasn&#8217;t easy. It was always twenty-four-seven because there were so many students and so many different expectations. But we didn&#8217;t have, it sounds so funny but we barely had the internet when I first started. We didn&#8217;t have email. There was no Facebook. So there were certain things that take a lot of time nowadays that you didn&#8217;t have then. You had, we were doing paper letters, those kinds of things. It was very, very different. That brings me to the thought when I started at the rape crisis center. Two people on the staff had email, Christina and the Orange County office. Christina in the northern Orange office had it because they had set up her office fairly recently,in the last year and they wanted her to have email so that she could communicate easily with the staff in Chapel Hill, and Matt may have been the one that had it because he would copy messages for Margaret Henderson.Reference 5 - 1.93% CoverageNow that doesn&#8217;t mean that we had everything solved, and there were lots of bumpy issues around sexual assault when I was at the university where we were starting [to] doing more training and things like that. And the Rape Crisis Center had been pushing for us to do a better job. By the time I got to UNC they were already pushing for that. That would be interesting research to look back at some of the cases, some of the around 1992, [19]93 you&#8217;d find some interesting news articles. SB: Yeah. Right when the student governments started adjudicating cases under the honor system of sexual assault. MB: Yeah, I don&#8217;t know how far that went back, but yeah it probably went back to the late [19]80s, early [19]90s.Reference 6 - 1.33% Coverage I have to be cautious because I don&#8217;t want to share things that would&#8217;ve been confidential obviously. That many years ago it&#8217;s hard maybe to separate, but there definitely was some public controversy because the Committee on Student Conduct was considering all the policies based on input they had gotten from the Rape Crisis Center as well as from some student groups like the Rape Action Project and the, what was the organization called? It might have been called Women Against Rape.Reference 7 - 2.63% CoverageMB: And ASAP might have been the WAR first and the Rape Action Project. So all that was swirling around when I came to UNC, which ultimately helped. Over my years, the seven years I was at UNC I was not always the direct sexual assault person. There were other people in our office, mainly Sibby Anderson-Thompkins and Michelle Cofield and later Don Appiairus because I was the Judicial Officer. So I tended to do a lot of sexual assault to help train about what it was like to go through the student judicial system. And because we would have gaps in coverage somebody would leave, and then it would take a while to replace, I was the direct person a lot of times, for sometimes as much as a year at a time. But I wasn&#8217;t always that direct person and so that was always something that stayed with me that that was an interest I was, I wanted to do more on, which was a big part of what led me to the Rape Crisis Center, bringing it back to OCRCC. And actually when I got to the Rape CrisisReference 8 - 5.62% Coverage One of the things that brought me to Rape Crisis was the desire to be more of an advocate. When you&#8217;re a Judicial Officer, you can&#8217;t be an advocate. You have to be really balanced and you can support students who are in front of you and you can help them know what their resources are and where they can go, but you have to really balance that, if you&#8217;re the Judicial Officer, you have to see the whole picture and make sure everybody&#8217;s getting fair judgment. Honestly, wanting to be more overtly, do more overt advocacy was part of what drew me to the Rape Crisis Center. Because you&#8217;re always in different roles. SB: Interesting. It&#8217;s knowing the whole picture, coming to the Rape Crisis Center but you had to know what it was like to be a respondng party within the system. That sounds like a really valuable set of experiences. MB: Yeah, I mean it was different. For me it was nice to have more focus on one issue. Sexual violence is obviously broader than one issue. So it&#8217;s very broad. But coming from UNC I was dealing with academic dishonesty; I was dealing with substance abuse issues, alcohol, sexual violence, student crises, suicide prevention, all of this wide range of issues. And so it was freeing to come and focus more directly on one issue that&#8217;s really important and that intersects with so many other issues in a lot of ways. And that&#8217;s one of the things I love about the Rape Crisis Center is that it stayed true to its mission and a really focused mission, and sometimes there&#8217;s temptations to bring issues together which you do to solve problems, but I think sexual violence especially lends itself to getting submerged if you don&#8217;t have something that focuses directly on it. So I&#8217;ve been really proud that the Rape Crisis Center has continued to have rape in the name for example. And that was a debate that every once in a while would come up in my years. I think it always does. &#8220;Oh, should we consider changing the name? Should we make it broader?&#8221; And ultimately folks would always go back to the sign on Estes Drive.Reference 9 - 1.90% CoverageMB: Well I don&#8217;t remember. We only had one working bathroom there. So I guess everything was gender non-specific. SB: Gender non-specific. MB: In the Estes Drive space. SB: Estes Drive, then it must be Rosemary Street. I feel like this person came within this millennium. MB: I don&#8217;t know. I only remember one. We had one little bathroom that was in one of the offices, but it usually didn&#8217;t work and was storage. But the folks at Amity Methodist Church by and large were very nice about fixing things up. They were our landlords. The church next door was the landlord. And you&#8217;re talking, speaking about the oppression issues and the intersection between sexual violence. Really neat historically.Reference 10 - 4.41% CoverageMB: She is now a Carrboro Board of Alderman. And Michelle was a volunteer at the Rape Crisis Center and eventually was on the Board and was on the staff for a while and she was very instrumental. I learned a great deal from her. She had given me some input, and she really helped us start a Diversity Committee and to think intentionally about how sexual violence intersects with other forms of oppression. Then when we did strategic planning probably either midway or a little more than that when I was at the Rape Crisis Center, we did a big strategic planning process. We ended up with a vision. I was sharing it last week because I was doing a training about a form of strategic planning and facilitating the meeting and I said oh when I was at the Rape Crisis Center our vision was a world free of sexual violence and all other forms of oppression. That may still be the vision. I haven&#8217;t looked at it lately but very ambitious. And then we tried to focus in our mission on stopping sexual violence and its impact through support, education and advocacy. Thanks to the incredible volunteers like Michelle and Linda Brooks and some other folks, really we did try to focus on diversity in a really intentional way, not just one aspect but lots of different aspects. And we focused a lot on disability issues, we were very fortunate, there was a project going on with the state Office of Health and Disability, and they contacted us and said, we would like to provide you all with funding and support to improve your services for survivors of sexual assault with disabilities. And so they came in and did an assessment for us and helped implement a lot of things.Reference 11 - 5.93% CoverageMB: Well, I mean for me and maybe not for everybody, the Rape Crisis Center when I was working here it really was a family to me. It was, as you can imagine, pretty intense to work in sexual violence. You may work in it yourself. But it&#8217;s very intense and to do it you develop a lot of camaraderie and really love and support for the folks you work with. So it seemed normal. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t normal. But a Rape Crisis Center is not just your garden variety workplace. SB: In order to not have people dropping out every few years, which still happens for a number of great reasons you need to have strong, something other than a passion for ending rape because&#8212;. MB: Yeah, you need a lot of support and, but I do think that that&#8217;s part of what makes it hard to stay in for a long, long time. I mean eight years definitely seemed like a long time. It is that intensity of, intensity of the issue, intensity of the work, intensity of keeping a small nonprofit afloat. So kudos to Shamecca and everybody for keeping it going. SB: Forty years, almost. It&#8217;s amazing because I developed relationships or been friends with people who do this sort of work and this is a twenty year old but only have relationships with people who have done this, this kind of work. Was it strange going out of rape crisis work or--? MB: Oh definitely. SB: Yeah. MB: Definitely. Because, even now it feels strange sometimes during holidays and things where I&#8217;m not thinking about who might have the pager or should I have the pager or I&#8217;m not on&#8212;I&#8217;m not thinking about who&#8217;s on call. But that is a big deal. When you&#8217;re working in Rape Crisis Center, you&#8217;re always aware that somebody is on call. I ran into last week because we have kids at the same school, a man who was a detective. And he doesn&#8217;t work in that field anymore either, but he was a detective who investigated sexual assault cases and we were reminiscing about being at the hospital in the middle of the night and never sure what the call was going to be and those kinds of things and so it does. It feels --I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a certain amount of -- well there&#8217;s really a great appreciation for those who are doing itReference 12 - 4.33% CoverageMary and I had the distinct experience of going to court at one time to try to keep Rape Crisis Center records private. So that felt like a historical moment. So I joke sometimes when people, people wonder if I can keep something confidential. And I&#8217;ll say sometimes well, I went to court before to protect confidentiality. You can trust me. I&#8217;m not going to spill your secrets. So that was a big thing where we had been served with a subpoena to release some client records and there&#8217;s a lot of media, and there was a lot of media coverage around that. Bob Epting, who is this fantastic local attorney who is also a pilot and flies small planes ( ). Bob came and represented us for free as we didn&#8217;t think we should have to release records. So that was an important moment and we got recognized for that work by the NC Center for Nonprofits. Somewhere around here there&#8217;s a little award from that. So that was good. That felt like we were doing something for other Rape Crisis Centers as well. We also had other board presidents like Shauna Hay and Shelley Golden and Elin Abercrombie and Amy Preble, just really great folks. Most of our board presidents while I was at the Rape Crisis Center came from the pool of volunteers. They had been trained in being a rape crisis companion or being a Community Educator and came at it with that strong training and then rose into being a leader, being a Board President type of leader. That was really important that folks have that grounding. One thing that really stayed strong and still is that commitment to strong training which is expensive if you think about it<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Basham_Janelle> - § 2 references coded  [2.39% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.39% Coverage I do not believe abortion should be an option for many different reasons and that&#8217;s primarily because of my first pregnancy and because it was drilled into me that, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t even about you, Janelle. This is about this baby, and you have to give her a chance.&#8221; I was on board with that, and I&#8217;ve seen it over and over and over again. These kids that maybe even their birth mom didn&#8217;t want them, they wanted to leave the hospital and have nothing to do with that child, those kids are amazing. And seeing these families that have such a desire to adopt and bring kids that aren&#8217;t biologically connected to them into their family and say, &#8220;You&#8217;re my daughter or son.&#8221; I can&#8217;t say to a young lady, &#8220;Hey, abortion is the way to go,&#8221; and then turn to this family and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that you can&#8217;t adopt because she aborted the child.&#8221; I&#8217;ve seen the beauty of life, and when I look at it from that perspective, it&#8217;s not a woman&#8217;s right issue. It&#8217;s totally about giving that kid a chance. If they want to mess up their life, that is totally up to them to mess up, but give that kid a chance at whatever God created him or her to be. I&#8217;ve seen it over and over and over again where, if someday my daughter comes home and says, &#8220;This is the predicament I&#8217;m in. I was raped. The father of the baby is older, the baby&#8217;s sick,&#8221; or whatever. If God doesn&#8217;t want that pregnancy to happen, let him be in charge of that.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Begalla_Martha> - § 2 references coded  [4.09% Coverage]References 1-2 - 4.09% CoverageOh, I know, we also started the Rape Crisis Center, which is now the Sexual Assault Crisis Center. JF: What was that like getting that started up? MB: Well, this is interesting because we just had a big reunion last night of all of the founders. It was VERY controversial cause there&#8217;ve been a number of rapes around the university. Melvin Laird was the Secretary of Defense under, who was he Secretary of Defense under? [Pause] Trying to think, way back when, anyway. His daughter was in school here and when she was at home in Washington, over summer vacation, she went to visit the first Rape Crisis Center that was sent up in the country and that was in Washington DC. She came back and got a group of faculty and graduate students and we were the second Rape Crisis Center that was set up in the United States. The current mayor at that time was an attorney and he helped with all incorporation and those sorts of things. A lot of resistance from the police, which is very different today. Now there&#8217;s a great deal of collaboration, we even have a forensic nursing part of the center. Victims are not even taken to the hospital initially; they&#8217;re all brought to the nursing unit at the Sexual Assault Crisis Center. JF: What was the resistance, what the resistance ws about in the [19]70&#8217;s-- MB: From the police? Oh, &#8220;she deserved it.&#8221; You know, &#8220;she brought on the rape.&#8221; Just all those real, real traditional- in fact last night the chief of police said to us, he said, &#8220;You know, law enforcement really has changed in those thirty-seven years.&#8221; JF: Wow. MB: Yeah, it&#8217;s unbelievable. Because now all of the police transport victims to the Sexual Assault Crisis Center. JF: So it sounds like there was-- MB: Lot of stuff going on.

Well I mean I&#8217;m much more aware of and some in my work now focused on issues: sexual abuse of women, domestic violence--. [Interrupted by PA system announcement] As well as political rights of women in certain countries and where they haven&#8217;t been really exercised. I&#8217;m doing a little bit of work in Rwanda right now, which is such a fascinating country full of contradictions. I mean most any country is but that one is very close to the surface so it&#8217;s gotten a lot of press as having the highest percentage of women in elected office in the parliament there. JW: Mm hmm. BB: And it&#8217;s true, they&#8217;re there, but there&#8217;s this huge gap, enormous gap, [what&#8217;s going on with the men in that country.] I think a lot more about how you help women develop the skills and knowledge to be active in formal political arenas, much more than I did when I was younger, both in Rwanda or in this country also. I mean I&#8217;d say that women in Afghanistan that I know have a much stronger sense of themselves as needing to be politically active in their community than women here do. I worked for a couple of years with literacy programs in small rural communities in Afghanistan where women are learning to take a real active role in the community development councils and doing all these things that are pretty exciting. [Pause] But how has my understanding of women&#8217;s rights changed? I&#8217;m still not getting at your question. I&#8217;m not sure that I--. [Pause] JW: Well, I think you are, I mean--.

In taking a rights based approach to education or this international work I&#8217;m doing, I&#8217;ve often thought about what would it mean to take a rights based approach. In my work we really work on issues of human rights, specifically on women&#8217;s rights but human rights. I wonder to what extent people in this country would say that they&#8217;re taking a rights based approach. <Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Benedict_Salli> - § 5 references coded  [7.26% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.46% CoverageSB: Well, what women always say when women get together like that, is how empowering it is. In the very, very beginning with consciousness-raising, the phrase was &#8220;personal is political,&#8221; and that is an incredible statement. I remember in the late &#8217;60s feeling that, &#8220;You mean I&#8217;m not the only one? I&#8217;m not the only one who&#8217;s felt this way?&#8221; And guess what? It&#8217;s not just about an individual woman. It&#8217;s a whole system. I think these HOPE Circles did the same thing for women, where they would get together and they would say, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ve had this problem with the banks too. They&#8217;ve treated me this way.&#8221; So what can we do with banks to help, because banks discriminate against low income women, right? So there was that, and then there was the sharing of the personal stories. A lot of women have stories, sad stories of abuse, rape, violence. Many, many women have been battered and they would share those and we would hear about that. I know there was one leader training that I was [at] with Marci Campbell and me&#8211;-Marci was the PI of the projects&#8211;-and we were all crying because women were talking about these stories. But for them, then they would say, &#8220;It&#8217;s so wonderful to have a place to go and be able to say whatever you want to say and not be judged for it.&#8221; There was a vow of confidentiality in the circles, and that was one of the major ground rules, is nothing goes out of the circle. So it was powerful in many ways, and it&#8217;s hard to quantify that kind of thing with surveys, but then with the qualitative piece where women can say what it&#8217;s meant to them, it&#8217;s powerful.References 3-4 - 3.39% CoverageSB: Well, let me see if I can remember, because it&#8217;s a long time ago. I remember we would sit together and we would often have a topic, and topics would be your parents, or how you were raised to think about sports, sex. I know I remember one evening it was about sexual abuse, and I had not thought about it since I was a child, but when I was twelve I was abused by a friend of my mom and dad&#8217;s, and it was horrible. It was traumatic. I had repressed it, and because we were talking about it in this group I remembered it, but I didn&#8217;t remember-&#8211;. I wasn&#8217;t ashamed of it anymore because every single woman in the group, every one, had either been raped or abused in some way, every woman. One friend of mine was talking about she was hitchhiking in her hometown and this guy that she knew picked her up and raped her, and I don&#8217;t think she even reported it. But it was everybody, so that&#8217;s such a good example of &#8220;the personal is political,&#8221; because when women are abused or raped, often we are ashamed of ourselves and we hide it, and my parents certainly never-&#8211;. I never told my parents. I never opened my mouth. I just turned into this really angry little girl for a couple of years and I hated my mother, because part of the way that I was raised in those days, adults were right and children weren&#8217;t. You respected adults and you weren&#8217;t taught, like kids are now, that it&#8217;s okay to tell if someone does something. But that was that meeting that night that I remembered it and I went through&#8211;-. It raised my consciousness about women and about experience. MK: That&#8217;s really powerful. SB: It was really powerful, and I don&#8217;t remember all of the-&#8211;. I do remember processing whether or not I was going to have an abortion with my first child, and I actually knew I wasn&#8217;t going to. I mean I was happily married and I always wanted children and I didn&#8217;t get pregnant on purpose, but I remember talking about that. There are things I want-&#8211;. And you&#8217;re weighing it, it was an option, but then I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have the baby. I want this baby.&#8221; But it was like there wasn&#8217;t anything you couldn&#8217;t talk about, and that was the first time in my life, Mary, that I could talk without feeling ashamed of things. Reference 5 - 1.40% CoverageThey said, &#8220;We&#8217;re really concerned about&#8211;-.

We can still work through the workplaces, because there&#8217;s thousands of women in the workplaces, and there are great programs about domestic violence coming to work.&#8221; Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not that rare for a boyfriend or a husband to stalk his wife or girlfriend at work or the parking lot, guns and things like that. So that&#8217;s where we were able to bring in people from UNC, women from UNC, and bring in the local domestic violence agencies to help us figure out how to do these programs, and some of the stories that women would say about the inequality in their relationships<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Brown_Donna_Uma_Aisha_HaQQ_Amira_Inas> - § 1 reference coded  [1.42% Coverage]Reference 1 - 1.42% CoverageRight now, I&#8217;m just a little bit upset about how much women are going through in terms of these wars and just the fallout from the natural disasters.

The things that women and children have to go through in the world just in terms of who&#8217;s on the bottom of the list in relation to hunger. Who&#8217;s hungry? Who&#8217;s unemployed the most? Who&#8217;s not getting medical care? Who&#8217;s getting laughed at in Haiti when they&#8217;re reporting being raped in the camp that they have to live in because they&#8217;ve lost their homes? Who&#8217;s at the brunt end of the police laughing and not responding and not doing something to help them? It&#8217;s women and children. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s enough progress, even if there is progress. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s at the level of an advanced society. And I think there may be societies in history that have probably just not recorded that they did better than people are doing now on some of those issues. Because there may be more - even women&#8217;s leadership of nations and governments, heads of state - there may be more women in history than there actually are now that are coming about in different parliaments and different governments.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Brown_Laura_Clark> - § 1 reference coded  [1.98% Coverage]Reference 1 - 1.98% CoverageThere was also, at the timeÃ¢Â€Â”thi5 kind of swings towards the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s issue.

They won&#8217;t go to daycares, they won&#8217;t go to preschool, they don&#8217;t go to Head Start and people never know they&#8217;re there, so by the time they get into the school system and they&#8217;ve been abused they don&#8217;t make it, and there&#8217;s a lot of them. And I&#8217;m not just talking about sexual abuse; I&#8217;m talking emotional and physical. PC: And also in the area where Harry works and where we go to, it&#8217;s right on the Kentucky/Tennessee border and sometimes people can&#8217;t get help. Reference 2 - 3.90% CoveragePC: Home schooled. HC: But the other thing, I don&#8217;t want to say there&#8217;s no hope. I&#8217;m trying to get a mental health--. See the problem, every case I&#8217;ve had with a girl where she&#8217;s been severely abused sexually the state has put her in custody, they&#8217;ve put her in a situation where there&#8217;s no mental health, what I call real mental health system. It&#8217;s short term, it&#8217;s not effective, so another area I really want to work on, and I&#8217;m trying to work on this now, is getting mental health up there with video conferencing, because we can&#8217;t get psychiatrists up there. There&#8217;s a friend of mine who works with Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and we&#8217;ve been up to the hospital to talk to them about putting a video conferencing center up there and using the psychiatrist down here to work the counseling, so that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re working on. We&#8217;re trying to get the state more aware of the abuse problem and do something about it so we are trying to do things, but the problem is so deep rooted and so severe that it&#8217;s--. We&#8217;re trying to do little things at a time, I guess, but the focus is on those children. It&#8217;s still on those children. DC: And you&#8217;ve got to get to them that young, is what I&#8217;m hearing. HC: Oh, I think so. You&#8217;ve got to get them--. The thing is if you get a child that&#8217;s been in an abusive situation, say seven years later they go into grade school, they don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on around them, really. Then they get into high school and that&#8217;s when they start dropping out and they become very sexual. The girls, at thirteen a lot of them are pregnant, and you find there&#8217;s an inordinate number of gils--seven, eight, nine, ten--that are very sexual. A lot of ministers and I talk about it. We sit there and say, we&#8217;ve got to be very careful about being around these girls, and it doesn&#8217;t matter what age you are. They&#8217;re repeating what they see in the homes. So you&#8217;ve got to try to get them--. We feel we&#8217;ve got to get them as early as possible. I wish we could go on to five and six and teach them as much as--I mean older--what they should do and shouldn&#8217;t do. We always find, I guess, that when they get into high school, they get out of that grammar school in eighth grade and they start going to high school, that&#8217;s when they start--. Now the girls that are severely abused, I would say they probably never get--. They might get into high school but I doubt if they&#8217;re capable of getting through it because they have personality disorders and all kinds of situations. They&#8217;re severely damaged, and there&#8217;s a lot of them. There&#8217;s an inordinate number.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Cravey_Altha> - § 2 references coded  [9.17% Coverage]Reference 1 - 6.40% CoverageSo the two things at once have really been important to me this year, about the kinds of issues that especially young women are facing&#8211;young people, but especially young women are facing&#8211;on college campuses. I just thought that was old history. [Laughs] SCB: To give the listeners some context, this spring, and last fall as well, several students have filed complaints against the university and now the university is in the process of revising its sexual assault policies to comply with Title IX and the Clery Act and other nondiscrimination policies, which leads me to another question. You&#8217;ve spent your adult life in a time when Title IX has been implemented, and you spoke just now about how it&#8217;s interesting to see how we&#8217;re still struggling with things that should have been over and done. Was Title IX a big event for you, having that in place? AC: Yeah, I was aware of it, but it didn&#8217;t seem like such a big event. It seemed like part of a larger flow of things, a larger, huge change that I felt was so obvious. So clearly I was aware of that but less aware of the kind of backlash that was happening, less aware of the way things were sliding in a different direction, because in particular I felt like we had won these battles. That is, women had won these battles in the &#8217;60s about not re-victimizing survivors of sexual assault. It seemed like we had taught judges and lawyers not to re-victimize survivors in the courtroom and we&#8217;d taught even newspapers and mass media these important lessons, and all of a sudden&#8211;. That&#8217;s why I was so shocked last spring to realize all around me, on a public college campus, these things that I thought were history were very current in terms of re-victimization, and re-victimization by the people I least expected, the university staff. So back to this question, Title IX&#8217;s forty years old, right, and the Clery Act is twenty years old, so it seemed like those broader kinds of shifts and broader kinds of education that had happened around sexual violence and about re-victimization, it seemed so sad and shocking to me that&#8211;. And apparently on lots and lots of public campuses and private campuses this is happening, this epidemic of rape culture is happening, and being permitted by administrators who&#8217;d rather sell their brand and keep things quiet rather than actually protect all students. I don&#8217;t know, it just kind of&#8211;. [Laughs] I&#8217;m still shocked about it. Reference 2 - 2.78% Coverage AC: It&#8217;s actually been really good for me to see the cases but also to see the activism. It&#8217;s been really inspiring to me to see people come together and say this is not right in various ways, letters to the editor, the challenge itself, the court case challenge. How would I explain that? The challenge, it&#8217;s in the department of education, is that right? SCB: Yeah. AC: These claims that got my attention in the spring, [not only serve to] remind me that I am an activist and to remind me that I am a human being who can make changes with others and join with others, but [also] that I can act on my own, I can act with others, and remind me about that responsibility. Maybe those quiet periods for me are when I&#8217;m discouraged or not as connected to people who share those values with me, because now I feel like I&#8217;ve got reconnected with some of those people who share my values, and it seems hard to imagine that I&#8217;d get away from that again, but probably I&#8217;ll have some more dips [Laughs] in my life. But, yeah, it&#8217;s good to think about.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Davis_Catherine> - § 1 reference coded  [2.29% Coverage]Reference 1 - 2.29% CoverageAt the end of the first year Dan began to talk about wanting to offer a piece of legislation for the 2010 cycle and I started talking about, which I had been talking about the entire time, black children are an endangered species. If we don&#8217;t do something we are going to end up not here, we&#8217;re going to be extinct, so can we write a piece of legislation that&#8217;s like the Endangered Species Act, because that&#8217;s really what&#8217;s happening to our babies. At the same time that I began saying that in the spring of 2009 a videographer by the name of Chad Bonham had asked me would I be a part of this video that he was doing, and I&#8217;m like, sure. So I invited him here and he came and we did a video and while he was here he said, &#8220;Do you know Ryan Bomberger?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, never heard of him. Who&#8217;s Ryan Bomberger?&#8221; So he told me a little bit of Ryan&#8217;s story, that Ryan&#8217;s mother had been raped and she chose adoption rather than abortion, even though abortion was legal at the time she had been raped. So Chad kept urging me, call Ryan, call Ryan, call Ryan, and so he bugged me so much I said, &#8220;Okay, Lord, you must be telling me to call Ryan.&#8221; So I did and he and I had a lunch. That was in like April, May of 2009. In October of 2009 I had said to Ryan, &#8220;If our children were animals they&#8217;d be on the endangered species list,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;I say that all the time,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, yeah, because it&#8217;s true. Well we had a regional meeting of Georgia Right to Life in Macon, Georgia. Ryan lives in Alpharetta. The offices of Georgia Right to Life at the time were in Lawrenceville, but he drove to Macon and he brought his computer and he did this thing on the computer and then he turned the screen around and said, &#8220;Look,&#8221; and on it was the billboard, &#8220;Black children are an endangered species. Toomanyaborted.com,&#8221; and when I saw that I was like, wow. That is what I&#8217;m talking about. So I said let&#8217;s show it to Dan, so we called Dan over and Dan came over and I said, &#8220;Dan, look,&#8221; and he looked at it and he said, &#8220;Ooh, that&#8217;s a billboard.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yeah, it is.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Praise God.&#8221; So that&#8217;s how we came up with the &#8220;black children are an endangered species&#8221; campaign<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_DeSelm_Bee> - § 2 references coded  [1.10% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.10% CoverageBD: No, only that we worked for a long time getting the police departments to train their officers well, and I think they are training now and I think it&#8217;s working fairly effectively.

I started one in California, in San Francisco. There was one group of us, a small group there. A couple of women were flight attendants. Actually, almost all the women I knew either were, or had been, flight attendants. And in fact, I have two friends now who I&#8217;ve known since we were flight attendants together, who I&#8217;m still friends with. They both live on the west coast, they both live in the Seattle area. It&#8217;s funny. And one of them who had been my roommate, her daughters are my godchildren. So we still have that connection. So all the women either were, or had been, flight attendants, who were in this consciousness-raising group. And some of that was also from the union, because some of the women in the union, some of the women I flew with who were in the union, and who were active in the union were more political. And truthfully, it was San Francisco, and so probably as a group we were more feisty and political than some of the other places. So anyway, yeah, we had a consciousness-raising group there. And then when I came back here, I started one here. I think those were really big. I think those were really--. It&#8217;s hard. This probably sounds inflated and pompous to say that they we were really revolutionary, but in a way they really were. Because it was the only time, for all of us, it was the only time we ever really got to talk about those, or had a chance to even explore with each other, &#8220;Gee, have you ever been to the doctor and they did this to you?&#8221; Or talking about people who had been sexually abused, or raped--. I mean, that was never, ever talked about. So it truly was a liberating experience for people to be able to talk about that with each other, and find out that we had so many things in common, as far as those experiences as women. And the sad part of it was that often it didn&#8217;t go anywhere. You just shared all that, and then you felt personally empowered, but it didn&#8217;t necessarily lead to any action, which is always the case with us, with &#8220;lefties,&#8221; right? We talk a lot, but we don&#8217;t always take action. But it was incredible. It was an incredible part of the foundation of women&#8217;s awakening, if you will. And I think that some of the women&#8217;s work that I did in the [19]80s and &#8217;90s was that way, too. It was kind of, women opening up to each other and being able to say things they couldn&#8217;t say anywhere else. It was pretty important stuff.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Evans_Sara_M_(Sara_Margaret)> - § 2 references coded  [2.56% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.56% CoverageSE: I learned mostly about it in doing the interviews for personal politics.

My dad was just coming from his first tour in the military, in the army at that time, in the late [19]60s in Vietnam, so he had been shell shocked, and sadly he came back a very wounded soldier, not so much physically but mentally and psychologically wounded. He was placed at a local military hospital at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas and my mother was brought in with several other Mexican women to provide comfort, if you will, to the soldiers. There was an interesting placement of Mexican women at that time [in] the military hospitals in the area. They were not quite as innocent as candy stripers, nor were they as blatant as prostitutes or escorts, but there was this grey little area that they fell in. So these very young Mexican women, I&#8217;m unsure whether they were coerced to come &#8211; which I&#8217;m sure they were &#8211; but I don&#8217;t think many of them came too voluntarily [Laughs] on many different levels. When she was brought there she was brought to bring some companionship to the soldiers and she and my dad met and somehow an instant connection happened and they fell in love. References 2-3 - 1.67% CoverageShe is supposedly getting some type of&#8212;or giving some type of&#8212;services, providing some type of services, from a sexual standpoint, or sensual, or through the physical body. Yeah, I think I probably would consider that to be sex work, absolutely. So that may have been the foray into her coming into being a comfort woman, if you will. This is not my first time hearing about this kind of background for another mixed race child. My last husband was, too, a product of a very similar situation. He is Vietnamese and black and his mother was a prostitute in Vietnam, back in the late [19]60s, mid [19]60s, and she came across a black soldier that she subsequently fell in love with and had a child by him. She was very much a part of sex work, and I don&#8217;t think that was voluntary for her either, obviously, in Vietnam during that time, but she did keep that child. So that&#8217;s a reproductive justice standpoint as well: the ability to take care of your child and keep your child, as my mom chose to keep me. It was her choice.References 4-5 - 11.71% CoverageAt the same time there were certain things that, if they felt like they had trust of other people who were around them, they just did. This person that&#8217;s in their family, they just know they can trust them. They would think that the perpetrators would be living down the street or homeless or someone who may have a mental illness or someone who is a substance abuser. So I was very much protected by the outside community, but as we know, in 2011, oftentimes the perpetrator is not going to be that same stranger from down the street or somebody that you just come in contact with. Sometimes and oftentimes it&#8217;s going to be someone that you know and someone who&#8217;s been brought into the family. When you look at some of the stories that Anne Rice [author of the novel, Interview with the Vampire] created for the New Orleans area and you look at the entr&#233;e of the vampire, [for] the vampire to come into a person&#8217;s home, that person has to open the door. The person has to open the door, and the same thing happened with me. By virtue of me not having the protective systems in place, the door was open for the vampire to come in. When the vampire comes in then, they prey. That&#8217;s what they do. So that&#8217;s exactly what happened. I was eight years old and it went on continuously, with this one person who was a relative of my godmother, for the next two years. So I suffered in silence, and to be very honest, at that age, the way that I rationalized what was happening&#8212;I knew it was wrong&#8212;but when I looked at the situation at eight years old and saw how me and my grandmother were living, which was not extreme poverty but still very low income to where we couldn&#8217;t afford certain services or health care or a car or air conditioning or things like that. Because she had to work so much to try to take care of our rent and she was often gone, [I was] in the care of the landlord sometimes, and the landlord was the relative of my godmother, and they had a son that was considerably older than me. He was already a young man when I was only eight years old. So by my godmother thinking that this family member was going to be someone that she could trust and that we could trust, oftentimes when she turned her back she put me in the care of him and delivered me right into the hands of the vampire. So that meant complete and full access. But because his father was our landlord, I felt the responsibility for maintaining our house was bent on me taking the responsibility for providing for the needs that he had in mind. Even though they were wrong needs, I still felt like it was my responsibility to keep a roof over our head, and so that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t say anything. That&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t tell. CGD: So what happened to stop the abuse at ten? SG: He finally moved away. It wasn&#8217;t going to stop on its own. I didn&#8217;t have the wherewithal to stop it and I was too fearful to tell the family. For one, for fear of us losing our home, and number two, for fear of them not believing me. I&#8217;m this little biracial child who has extremely low value in the community as it is, so what value do I have? This is my thinking at eight years old, obviously, and so the only reason why it stopped was because he went to college. That was the only reason why it stopped. That was the only reason why it stopped, and I didn&#8217;t disclose it to my family on my mother&#8217;s side until I was getting ready to graduate from high school. There was a mental blockage of it for some number of years. Sometimes when children go through extreme psycholog[ical] trauma they block things out. They block out memories in their mind, and they&#8217;re blocked out for so long. As I began my teenage years, becoming a young woman, I think the way that began to manifest itself was in substance abuse. That&#8217;s how it began to manifest itself. It didn&#8217;t manifest itself in terms of sexual promiscuity by any means. I was extremely selective and very protective about that. In fact after the first time that I had sex with someone I went to my dad immediately and told him that he needed to get me on the birth control pill like tomorrow, because I&#8217;d just started having sex last night. After my dad passed out&#8212;. [Laughs] CGD: How old were you? SG: I was sixteen. I was sixteen years old and I gained strength sometime during that time frame, as I mentioned to you before, to confront my perpetrator. I found the strength to do that after I had enlisted into the military and I knew what I was going to do with my life and I felt empowered somehow. I saw him on the street one day. He came back and I saw him and stopped him, and I very boldly announced to him, &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to do this again. You had the opportunity to do it without any consent from me whatsoever, but I&#8217;m sixteen years old now. It&#8217;s been eight years; I dare you to try now. I dare you to try it now. I&#8217;m taking everything back and I&#8217;m not going to be silent anymore. I&#8217;m going to start telling people about it, and you can call me a liar if you want to but it&#8217;s the truth. I&#8217;m not going to allow you or any other man or any other person to silence me again and take my liberties from me. I&#8217;m going to always put that in the forefront of my agenda from now on, so thank you for that.&#8221; Right after that is when I decided that I wanted to start having consensual sex, and so again the early feminist in me decided to choose my own partner. I chose my own partner. It wasn&#8217;t someone I was in love with, it wasn&#8217;t someone that I felt very intimately about or was in love with or had any kind of romantic relationship [with]. There was someone that I thought would be the best fit for me, no pun intended. So I went up to my male friend and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to have sex tomorrow, and if you&#8217;re ready, let&#8217;s get condoms and let&#8217;s go.&#8221; He looked at me and said, &#8220;Well don&#8217;t you want the sweet romantic stuff and the candles and the soft music and the Keith Sweat playing in the background?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Keith Sweat is not needed. I&#8217;m ready to have consensual sex and either you&#8217;re going to be my partner or I&#8217;m going to find somebody else,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Okay, well I guess I&#8217;ll go ahead [Laughs] and get myself together.&#8221; So that was yet again another instance of being sexually liberated, even outside of being a survivor of child sexual molestation. I was able to yet again find a way to empower myself and take control of my sexuality, and my health also by going to my dad and announcing to him very strongly and boldly, &#8220;I need to be on the pill and I need for you to take me. You haven&#8217;t done anything else for me. I need you to do this. At least protect me from having children that I know I can&#8217;t take care of.&#8221; My grandmother was completely against the idea of me being on the pill because she was Catholic and so she was very much a conservative[ly] minded woman from the standpoint of family planning and pregnancy prevention. So I went to somebody who I knew would say yes. I cornered him [Laughs] into saying yes. So that was my upbringing, coming up as a young woman.References 6-7 - 1.19% CoverageOnce they understand the intersection of all that and see that human rights is at the core of all of it, it makes sense for all of us to be on the same team.

They also wanted to force us to adopt a culture, the Western culture that was completely contrary to who we are as Cherokees. Those experiences, three to four generations that went to boarding schools, has impacted what we are working on today, historical grief and trauma, addressing those issues, because it has had a huge impact on the last three or four generations. The children that was forced to go to boarding schools&#8212;and there&#8217;s probably over a hundred boarding schools throughout the United States. The first one was put in place in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. There was over twelve thousand Native American kids that were forced to attend that boarding school. They left their communities, their tribal communities, whole, grounded, and intact, spiritually, mentally, emotionally and physically. By the time they&#8212;if they were able to live through the boarding school experience many of them were psychologically wounded, sexually abused, traumatized because they were not allowed to speak their language, they were not allowed to practice any of their cultural and ceremonial teachings, they were not allowed to even associate with their own siblings. The federal government&#8217;s mindset was in order to save the man we must kill the Indian. They were not allowed to wear any of their traditional clothing, their hair was cut, and for many Native Americans that act alone is an indicator that someone has died, and so when they were forced to cut their hair then a lot of those children would mourn because they thought that a death had occurred. They were forced to wear uniforms. The mindset was that the indigenous people of the North American continent, all Native American tribes, were not intelligent enough to become professionals, so the females were taught to be seamstresses, maids, of that nature, you know, laundry workers, and of course the male students were trained to be laborers and carpentersReferences 2-3 - 2.68% CoverageYou have to remember that even though we are a tribe and of a sovereign nation we live the same way as everybody else does under the same dominant Western values, and that to me I think is what is really difficult, because when you try to apply tribal ways and values and beliefs it&#8217;s conflictual with Western values and beliefs. So either you adopt one or the other or you try to blend them together and it&#8217;s very difficult and complicated in a sense. But we have a lot of our women that get sexually abused. We have a lot of domestic violence. When you look at the statistics it is two and three times higher than the national average. We can&#8217;t even get the protection until President Obama signed the Tribal Law and Order Act, and that is so that more and more protection will be provided to the Native Americans. I don&#8217;t know the exact statistics but I think when they did the ceremony, when he signed it, the woman that spoke and told a bit of her story there at the press conference, it&#8217;s three out of five women will be sexually assaulted and raped throughout her lifetime and a high percentage will experience domestic violence. It&#8217;s horrendous. <Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Gruelle_Kit> - § 3 references coded  [11.53% Coverage]Reference 1 - 2.91% CoverageAnd so itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind of amazing for me that this is 2013 and weÃ¢Â€Â™re fighting these battles over sexual Violence against women, physical Violence against women, womenÃ¢Â€Â™s reproductive rights. I mean women are still by a sigmÃ¯Â¬ÂÅcant portion of the population regarded as inferior to men, and I just wonder linguistically what do we have to do to address this. WhatÃ¢Â€Â™s it going to take? How many dead women do we have to pile up before we realize that weÃ¢Â€Â™ve got blinders up or weÃ¢Â€Â™ve got our fingers in our ears and weÃ¢Â€Â™re saying la-la-la or both? I guess after all these years working with battered women and seeing the challenges they face that are, the initial source is the abuser. But then the state and the various agencies and institutions that she has to interact with to try to get Interview number U-lOO4 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill Gruelle 12 help, itÃ¢Â€Â™s like they drive the getaway car. The abuser commits the act, and then the state allows him to get away with it. So I really donÃ¢Â€Â™t know what itÃ¢Â€Â™s going to take. I hope the film is going to make people stop and think and say, Ã¢Â€ÂœI wonder what goes on in my community. I wonder how battered women are treated in my court. I wonder how the prosecutors handle these cases. I wonder if law enforcement treat these crimes seriously. I wonder if DSS [Department of Social Services] is punitive towards the woman rather than towards the abuser.Ã¢Â€Âù Reference 2 - 4.80% CoverageBut to be fair to law enforcement this is a frustrating crime to have to deal with because of this emotional link, this bond that the two have. I think for me the thing that makes me the most aggravated is weÃ¢Â€Â™re still stuck in this rut of saying, Ã¢Â€ÂœWhy doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t she just leave?Ã¢Â€Âù And that, number one, is a Victim blaming question. Number two, itÃ¢Â€Â™s the wrong question to ask. Number three, itÃ¢Â€Â™s taking the focus of the attention off of him, the offender, and putting it on her. And number four, we donÃ¢Â€Â™t do this with any other kind of crime. I mean when women are beaten up or sexually assaulted, we blame them, just period. But one of the things I've started saying when I go do community ed stuff is, Ã¢Â€Âœthink about the last time a bank got robbed in your community. And law enforcement showed up to investigate the robbery, and they got the evidence and the interviewed people, and then when they were done with the investigation, they probably didnÃ¢Â€Â™t go to the bank president and say why did you keep all that money here. DidnÃ¢Â€Â™t know you were going to get robbed? Do you like getting robbed? WeÃ¢Â€Â™ve been out here four or Ã¯Â¬ÂÅve times already. Why do you still have your doors open? I canÃ¢Â€Â™t believe, you must like this. Do you like to expose your staff to somebody showing up with a gun?Ã¢Â€Âù But we donÃ¢Â€Â™t do that. We just donÃ¢Â€Â™t. But for some reason we just reÃ¯Â¬Â‚exively blame women for the Violent acts of men, and that just, itÃ¢Â€Â™s so juvenile. And itÃ¢Â€Â™s so sexist, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s so wrong because when we do that weÃ¢Â€Â™re basically giving him a green light and saying, Ã¢Â€ÂœCarry on. Keep on going on with your Violent and controlling behavior.Ã¢Â€Âù WeÃ¢Â€Â™re just going to dump all the responsibility on her. We require her and the children to leave their homes, leave their schools, leave their jobs, leave their family, leave Interview number U-lOO4 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill Gruelle 14 their pets, leave their friends and go hide out in a shelter. And even that doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t guarantee her safety. So we expect battered women and children to reconfigure their lives completely around his Violence and rarely sanction him with any kind of comprehensive sanctions. So thatÃ¢Â€Â™s the area. So weÃ¢Â€Â™ve addressed the law enforcement piece, but I think now itÃ¢Â€Â™s time to address the larger sort of social response to gender based Violence and start to ask a whole new set of questions. Reference 3 - 3.81% CoverageKG: Well, IÃ¢Â€Â™m a big reader too. But I think documentary film can bring people together. I know what a profound impact Eyes on the Prize had on how people thought about ciVil rights work. The film that just came out The Invisible War about sexual assault in the military had a big impact. So there have been, documentary films throughout my adult lifetime that--I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know thereÃ¢Â€Â™s something about hearing something come out of someoneÃ¢Â€Â™s mouth combined with sort of the contextualization of the issue in a way that people who donÃ¢Â€Â™t do the work canÃ¢Â€Â™t see. Like in DeannaÃ¢Â€Â™s case, the woman whoÃ¢Â€Â™s in the film, you see her photographs because I take her pictures to the medical school because I taught at the med school for twenty-one years, and I would hold up DeannaÃ¢Â€Â™s photograph, and I would ask the medical students what they thought Robbie was charged with. And universally they said this is an attempted murder case. And when IÃ¢Â€Â™d say to them, Ã¢Â€ÂœNo, actually he was charged with one count of misdemeanor assault on a female.Ã¢Â€Âù And it just made their jaws drop because people just donÃ¢Â€Â™t understand what our laws do and do not say about gender based Violence. So I think doing a documentary film is going to make people, theyÃ¢Â€Â™ll see the images. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™ll see what the laws say. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™ll see how our state, how the state of North Carolina just shrugged its shoulders and continues to shrug its shoulders around this crime, and maybe itÃ¢Â€Â™s going to led to an honest and open discussion about patriarchy, about misogyny, about what our laws reÃ¯Â¬Â‚ect, which is patriarchy and misogyny. And then these legislators who claim to care so much about the fiscal health of this state will realize that when they turn their backs on battered women and children, weÃ¢Â€Â™re going to pay for it sooner or later. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™re going to pay for it horrendously, but we as a state will pay for it too. So thatÃ¢Â€Â™s why to me documentary film, itÃ¢Â€Â™s just so, itÃ¢Â€Â™s so important to do it this particular way.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Hatcher_Paris> - § 6 references coded  [4.23% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.50% Coverage PH: So I think&#8212;. So even now I&#8217;m very excited that reproductive justice exists as a framework and we&#8217;re in this intersectional movement building time. What&#8217;s interesting is that pre the RJ [reproductive justice] movement I think many of us who started to get our chops in activism and organizing start from anti-violence work, especially domestic violence and rape, because it&#8217;s really one of the only politicized spaces where you can really center women&#8217;s voices. But we&#8217;re also centered in the victim role, right, so it&#8217;s not really how we&#8217;re organizing and mobilizing proactively. However, I feel like the domestic violence and anti-rape work, there was always a part of, like not always responding to the immediate crisis but thinking, what are the things we need in our communities to end rape, and so I think a lot of us&#8212;. So I entered the world through domestic violence and anti-violence, especially domestic violence and ending rape work, and that&#8217;s still a really big piece of my passion [that] I think really connects to RJ like all the way, just a big connection.References 3-4 - 0.57% CoveragePH: So, from getting started there I went and I did an internship working on private prisons and organizing against private prisons.

And it's incredibly challenging in that the people suggesting that we do all this crazy stuff come from such a different place that I donÃ¢Â€Â™t really know how to talk to them. [150] For example, thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a set of conservative Republicans, mostly out of Catawba County, who want raise the age of eensent under statutory rape to sixteen, itÃ¢Â€Â™s thirteen now. Well, that's something that rape crisis centers are willing to support. However, the reason they want to do it is that they think they can end teenage pregnancy that way. Because they have the idea that Ã¯Â¬Â‚iereÃ¢Â€Â™s these guys aged Monty on up who have been getting all these teenÃ¢Â€Â”age girls pregnant and are not supporting them. And, itÃ¢Â€Â™s so far out there. It's so illogical that I donÃ¢Â€Â™t really lmow how to talk to them [laughs]. This is not based on fact. it is based on a couple of singular incidents and you know theyÃ¢Â€Â™re not looking at the other stuff, and I just donÃ¢Â€Â™t know how you edueate somebody who clearly doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to be educated, doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t want to hear the truth. So, my general outlook toward state and federal legislation is just getting grimtner and griouner. I stopped listening to NPR the day after the election. Ijust couldnÃ¢Â€Â™t stand it. I keep telling myself that the Republicans, bless their souls, just canÃ¢Â€Â™t help it. Being the way they are They sure do eome damage. And I think a lot of what we see is a reÃ¯Â¬Â‚ection of that; They donÃ¢Â€Â™t value women and they donÃ¢Â€Â™t value children. And unfortunately, that discomling is such a part of their culture that they canÃ¢Â€Â™t see that theyÃ¢Â€Â™re doing it. They really canÃ¢Â€Â™t understand the negative impact of their suggestions. Ah. it's like they really donÃ¢Â€Â™t understand that violence against women is an issue because itÃ¢Â€Â™s such an iristihiÃ¯Â¬ÂÅonalized issue, I mean, itÃ¢Â€Â˜s so widespread They donÃ¢Â€Â™t see it as being anything differem from the moon or the stars, you know.Reference 3 - 4.09% CoverageMargaret Yeah, weil I havenÃ¢Â€Â™t sortie tip with anything real concrete, because I think it's impossible to quantify Lynne: Yeah.

And all the energy you spend on that you have to divert away from achieving your potential. whatever that is. So we end up with, itÃ¢Â€Â™s not that folks are completely crippled or anything like that. itÃ¢Â€Â™s just that they ma},r not be everything that they could be in a perfect world, because theyÃ¢Â€Â™re having to divert a lot oir attention, or may have to at some point in their life, anyhow. Anti um relearnjng issues or just dealing with their own pain. Um, of course that varies widely from individual to individual. You canÃ¢Â€Â™t even stereotypically say that a person who is raped is likely to lose oh at least two weeks of work, you know, while she gets over it. You just canÃ¢Â€Â™t make stupid remarks like that. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not true. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not true. But you can he sure itÃ¢Â€Â™s going to take some energy.

In whatever form it comes in. And um ask people what we can do to work on that issue wherever they see it in their lives; I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think itÃ¢Â€Â™s appropriate to walk in and tell someone else that something necessarily is wrong, unless you're talking about some blatant act you known Urn it's Certainly a delicate issue to work 17' Interview number G-0165 in the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round VWson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill.

But some took it to such an extreme that they refused to consider that violence against women was a problem because it was perpetrated by men. And because they were envisioning a world in which there were no men, problems that were perpetrated by my were not our proper business or not their proper business. Excuse me? You know, all problems would be solved if we just refused to have men in our lives [60:00]. &#8220;Excuse me. I think lesbians get raped too.&#8221; SR: Right.

And that's when I chose, because I had not even chosen a senior topic and so I chose a senior topic and I chose sexual assault because my freshman year somebody was sexually assaulted. I'm telling you this out of chronological order because it matters in the scheme of things. So somebody was sexually assaulted by a football player and I, she came to my dorm room and my room is called "The rec" and it had R-E-C like recreation center because I went to college with a big TV and radio that's all not here or there [KL laughs], but I went to college with way too much stuff that wasn't really necessary for a college dorm. They didn't know. They knew I needed a TV and radio so they were like, "Sure!" 16 Monika Iohnson-Hostler So anyways she came to the rec to tell us what happened and that was my first introduction to rape or sexual assault or knowing anybody who openly said that they were sexually assaulted. And she told us what happened, but she didn't want to do anything. She didn't want to tell anybody. She just needed to tell somebody because she walked into the dorm crying, distraught, what have you. So I said, "Oh we can do something." She said "Well, I don't want to do anything." And so I was trying to Ã¯Â¬ÂÅgure out what we could do without saying who it was and it was football players. And so I thought we could take on the football players and I did. Needless to say, nothing changed for them. However they will remember that that's when it sparked for me that, "Oh, there's agencies that do something about this so we should at least have information available for people, for young women," and so rape crisis stuff became available in our dorms because I just didn't know what else to do at that point. So that's what I did I Ã¯Â¬ÂÅgured out who would know what to do. So that is how I chose my senior topic and I interviewed the Rape Crisis Center of Cumberland County and decided, "Oh this is pretty interesting. Like people can do this for a living and I don't have to be a pychiatrist to actually help people?" And so I did the paper and, a joint paper actually. I did it on African Americans who were sexually assaulted because then I became intrigued by incest and child sexual abuse and how it became very much a family thing. And of course I really only did African Americans because I was one and wanted to be able to ask my family who clearly was not interested in disclosing all these things. But I really had more of a conversation with my grandmother and my great aunt because I wanted a perspective from them, given everything was swept under the rug then. 17 Monika Iohnson-Hostler So I wrote the paper and I knew I was going to graduate in December and by that time I had already met who now is my husband. We had started dating that last year that I was at school and I didn't know when I wanted to get my Masters then because I knew I wasn't going to take any biology or botany [KL and PV laugh, 25:00]. So I didn't really know what a career choice was. I just knew that I wanted to do something to help people. And the thing that I always will say about Thomasville High School and the Thomasville School Systems, which they knew very little I would say, but they knew how to score aptitude tests and it was right. In the seventh grade a teacher told me, "You will do something to help people. That's innately who you are and it's what matters to you and it's what is important." She said "You scored very well in all of these other things, but everything came back to people." And that's true; it's in my DNA somehow. And so my husband, who is not my husband got a job in a small town in Scotland county as a math teacher and he called me because he graduated before I did and he was like, "There's a job at a rape crisis center and it is just now opening," and I was like, "Oh, why not?" So I went to interview with two people and I stood up to walk out and they were like "So when can you start work?" I was twenty, I wasn't even twenty-one yet and I was like, I'm pretty sure there are some question I should be asking, but since I didn't know what they were. I said, "I will call you back." So at any rate, so we had a conversation and they officially offered me the job.References 4-5 - 5.03% Coverage But I didn't know what I wanted to be and so I loved the job that I was doing. So I stayed on the job and I, the agency was a Rape Crisis Center and it started doing Domestic Violence and I had a couple of children and I knew that I probably would not be able to do direct services for long because there was not a systematic answer to stop what I was seeing. And for somebody who always thought that I could figure out an answer to the unjust and to the things that aren't fair I didn't have an answer to them. Society didn't, which still doesn't quite make sense to me and I've been doing this work now for almost seventeen years. I'm still not sure how as a society we don't keep our children safe and I think that was another turning point for me to realize that, "Okay I can't do direct services because clearly I don't have children. I cannot take all of these children into my home." I was in my twenties. That probably was not going to Ã¯Â¬Â‚y with my now husband either that I was bringing a bunch of kids home. The threats from perpetrators and abusers never bothered me. I didn't fear people who used physical or sexual Violence to have power over someone so I was never afraid. And it was a small town so I had quite a few threats but those things never bothered me. It was the children. I, I just didn't know why as a society nobody thought to make it their job to Ã¯Â¬ÂÅgure out how to keep them safe. So intervention is still really important to me. It was important to me then, but I left there knowing that there had to be another side to the work that I was doing in the local community. So while I was at the rape crisis center in Scotland county I came on the board of NC CASA in 1997, still in my early 20's. I came on the board here and a job 20 Monika Iohnson-Hostler came open for the Campus Rape Prevention Coordinator, which everybody knows my history in how I came to this work [30:00]. And so the Executive Director said," I think you should apply because it's where your passion started and how do you work with college campuses to help them deal with sexual assault on college campuses." So I came here in 1999 to do rape prevention education on college campuses and to write a sexual assault model policy for college campuses. So I did that in conjunction with the person that was the director for the Duke Women's Center. And I've been here ever since and I've probably held every job at the coalition [KL laughs]. And I'm sure there are detailed questions that you want to know but that was my college and that's how I got to my careerReferences 6-7 - 8.72% CoverageSo at NC CASA we're a statewide organization that is a membership organization for the ninety plus rape crisis centers in North Carolina. So every county is served by a rape crisis center but there are about sixty-three court agencies that have offices in about ninety-two counties. But then they have staff covering the other eight counties that there are not a physical ofÃ¯Â¬ÂÅce for sexual assault. So they provide direct services which is what I did in Scotland County for many years. But we do the training for those advocates. We also do law nforcement training on sexual assault specifically so impact of sexual Violence, prevalence and how to interview sexual assault survivors. We also train sexual assault nurse examiners forensic nurses on evidence collection and the importance of the survivor because what they do is scientific and what we do is let them know that that is a human being that is the evidence. And so we provide training there. We also provide training for anybody who needs it. We have a campus consortium which now we have probably over forty campuses who are a part of our campus consortium so they have their own advisory committee of campuses and we provide prevention training to them and with them because a lot of them now have federal grants that they have at their school universities to do sexual Violence or domestic Violence preventions; but we do the sexual assault side ofthings. And we also work with all of the state agencies on writing model policies. So we just wrote a policy on new research because I wrote one in 99. There wasn't a lot of research but now there's lots of research. And we also have an administration, our presidential administration who has this as a priority issue. So of course it helps to have the Vice 24 Monika Iohnson-Hostler president that has a, "One is too many," website on sexual assault that happens on college campuses. So that's a huge initiative for us, which we want to work on with the department of public health. You all interviewed the council for women so you all know they're a funder and we are, statutorily the coalition provides training to the agencies that they fund which are the rape crisis centers. So they fund direct services and we train direct service providers. So there is a lot ofturnover because now that I'm older I know that they really don't make a lot of money to do work that is stressful and that absolutely has a high turnover and burnout rate. I just did my Ã¯Â¬ÂÅrst career fair at my daughter's elementary school and I realized this is not a career that anyone will ever tell you that you can ever have. So I'm looking in her yearbook and it actually has where I work, but they asked me to come talk about being a non-proÃ¯Â¬ÂÅt director and I said, "Well that is really great of them to put where I work," because now somebody knows that is a career. Because even in college this isn't a career choice you'd think that you would do. Even women's studies majors, a lot of them think about policy which is now where I now spend the bulk of my time. So that's what we do our work revolves around training and education for direct service providers whether they are rape crisis centers or we call them allied professionals or first responders who would be involved in a sexual assault case, and then campuses. But we also do prevention work, which is also training people how to do prevention so society systematically understands that it is our job to change to prevent children from being sexually abused, not children and not just singularly parents but systems are also a part of that. So we do systems work as 25 Monika Iohnson-Hostler well which is mostly translated into policy. So we do both state and federal policy and so, which there will be a trend here. So in that I'm also the chair of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, which I have been for, my daughter's six so almost six years. I know that's a long time to be a chair [all laugh]. But it is a policy making body so all of our work and there's no staff so we're all volunteer so I tell people my 6-10 job which is when I leave here is to work with federal policy. That is in both writing and advocating for it, and that advocacy isn't just to Congress on the importance of passing legislation but it's also to agencies so that they understand why it's important that the policy governs their work. So that's my current focus, as a public policy in legislation. References 8-9 - 4.25% CoverageSo we have a lot of meetings because there's probably not a state entity that isn't impacted by our work. So that's health, that's human services, that's schools, that's universities, you know, it's department of administration. It's every agency or cabinet level agency that should be concerned about these issues. So we've done a good job because there is a state sexual assault coalition in all fifty states and territories including Washington D.C. So I'm a counterpart in all those states and territories which [cheer in the background from bridal shower, MJH laughs] make up the alliance the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence. And so a lot of those meetings are for really helping them understand 26 Monika Iohnson-Hostler where sexual Violence is integrated. So we're in the room so we at least understand that they should be there, but they don't necessarily always understand why I say, "I'm Monika Johnson-Hostler from the North Carolina Coalition to End Sexual Assault". Everybody in the room doesn't necessarily understand why we are there, so my job is to say why we are there. So if it's funding priorities you know I'm there to say to them, "You know sexual assault does this, this is what prevalence looks like in the school system. This is what prevalence looks like in you know adult facilities or nursing homes or group homes." So I always tell people there's probably not a facet of life that I can't probably tell you how it's connected because sexual assault happens across the lifespan and there are no boundaries. And so there's almost not somewhere we can't integrate sexual Violence. And it should be because again to get to, I really do come to work so that there is not a work for me to come to and that can't happen without convincing the rest of the world that it matters, and that we are the only ones that can keep women and children primarily safe. Because you know we have a society that allows perpetrators to continue to perpetrate; if we didn't we wouldn't still be dealing with it so. So that's what I'm doing at those meetings, telling them why it matters [KL and PV laugh] and how it fits into whatever they're talking about.References 10-11 - 8.43% CoverageMJH: So I have men on staffhere so I think they are integral to this work. My husband and I went on a vacation with some friends and one of the things he said which I think speaks to my thought on men in the movement, which I might add happened in 1998 right before we got married so I didn't realize that this would be about how I thought men were in the movement. But again I think it matters. I think everyone has a role in this work. I don't think, just like any other major, you know, political or human rights or social justice issue, it can't be stopped by the people who were persecuted. So there has always had to be allies in those that have 29 Monika Iohnson-Hostler privilege and power and that I also believe that those--which are in feminist principles--that you know, that the majority, whether it is men or whether it's based on race or sexual orientation or ability, there is always a privileged side of the coin. And so if those people with privilege and power aren't engaged in the work then we can keep doing the work but we're pushing up against in most cases the people who are perpetrating whatever it is and in my case it's sexual Violence. So the majority of perpetrators are men. We clearly have women who perpetrate, but the majority are men. And so I believe that other men have to hold men accountable because there are more good men then there are men who rape and so if the majority of those men do their work and are allies and really setting the standard--. My husband's a teacher. He teaches math. His job is to still integrate what I do, that it's important that you respect women even before our daughter. And he does that. I tell people every day, "If my husband could figure out how to integrate sexual Violence prevention in math [KL and PV laugh], you can figure out how to integrate it anywhere. So I guess what I would say is I've always known the importance of men in the work. But I do have some feelings about it that I think we're going to have to work out in this work. That men have come into this work and I've said to men that come into the work, they come in and they charge their worth because again that's a privilege that men have. Men tend to say, "we'll charge $10,000 just to tell you why men should be allies." People ask me to come speak all the time, I'm like, "Oh it's free." NCCASA doesn't have travel so you may have to pay for my plane ticket, but like those things don't matter because most of the women who do this work do it because it matters and because it is important to them and I 30 Monika Iohnson-Hostler think men that come to this work believe that. But men are also socialized very differently than women and so they ask for their worth. And I don't think that's wrong, but I do think it matters in the work because now we're able to see yet again a disparity being played out in a work where we're trying to move to equality for men and women. KL: Right. MJH: Because the anti-rape movement that's about ending rape but it's also about social justice and equality and liVing in a culture where women and girls are not hyper-sexualized so that they do have, they are coming to the table with some forms of privilege and power that are not associated with being male or of a certain race or a certain dominant group and all of those things I think are interwoven into our work. If I do this work from a place of know that the most vulnerable people to being sexually violated are on the other side ofthe non-privileged side of the coin. So people of color, people that have disabilities, people who you know are female. People who are children, people who don't live, their sexual preference is not heterosexual which is dominant in this culture. Like all of those people are closer to the margin of vulnerability in sexual Violence and we know this based off of prevalence numbers. The amnesty report among Native Americans I think has been eye opening to this country for people who have been listening even a little bit. To see that all of those things matter how we treat people in this country. KL: Right [laughs]. 31 Monika Iohnson-Hostler MJH: Again there's probably not a thing that you can't come up with that I cannot integrate this in. So that's my framework. Right or wrong that's how I live. That's Monika's philosophy.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Judy_Rebecca_Ann> - § 4 references coded  [23.01% Coverage]References 1-2 - 17.11% Coverage I was not as active on the local level, but I joined NOW and all those good old great ones and became a real advocate for not just social workers, but women in those positions, women in the field. So that&#8217;s been my focus all these years. I&#8217;m a very verbal person, and so I made lots of speeches when I was with-the next program that I worked in in Child and Family was the Project Against Sexual Abuse of Appalachian Children. So that included, as I shared with you on the phone, I think, that agency had sort of a research project that started with setting up a helpline in 1979. The helpline was for women and children to call in and report just to the helpline or just to talk about their abuse, primarily sexual abuse was the target. And that meant any women that had been sexually abused as a child or were still or had been raped or a child that had been molested or somehow been offended sexually. So that sort of experiment or, in research terms, sort of out there to gather data, that following next year, the referrals to the Department of Human Services went up four hundred percent. So that data was used to support getting the funding for a regional research and service delivery system for abuse victims and so that&#8217;s where the Project Against Sexual Abuse of Appalachian Children. It&#8217;s an unwieldy name, but PASAAC, and I was clinical supervisor there for six years. So I did a lot of speaking at that time throughout the southeast. And what we did was try to get the various parts of the systems that deal with abuse to talk to each other. Police-if a rape was reported, how do they talk to the victim? What kind of services were available at the emergency center, the emergency rooms? Of course, the Department of Human Services that gave services to children, often they weren&#8217;t communicating with anybody. The sheriff&#8217;s department, the police, all of those people needed to coordinate services and learn how to not do further damage because the interrogation, particularly around rape, man, it was almost as bad as the rape sometimes for women. So we advocated strongly for that to change and for a more humane, more private inquiry, and did a lot of training throughout the southeast all the way from Texas to South Carolina, Florida. JW: Was there openness to that kind of change or what was that process like? RJ: What was that process? (laughs) Well, the big resistance, you can imagine, was from [males].We wanted to include doctors and many physicians would not, were the most resistant group. And I&#8217;m not sure why that was. I think a lot of that was because there weren&#8217;t very many women physicians at that point. And I think that, number one, a lot of men had not been trained to really see rape as [a crime]. They saw it as, well, did she have any injuries, was she pregnant, and that&#8217;s it, and not any of the psychological impact of being assaulted that way. JW: Were you trying to get them to report cases? RJ: Yes, definitely trying to get, well, trying to help them help the victim, to take charge, and to talk about it. A lot of women still won&#8217;t talk about being raped because back then, of course, there was very anti-female [attitude]. First of all, rape didn&#8217;t exist. Number two, if you were raped, you asked for it, you wanted it, because you wore that skirt too short or you were being seductive or you didn&#8217;t say &#8220;no&#8221; loud enough. Why did you finally give in? Nobody can [be raped]. It was a lot of old boy things: &#8220;Well, nobody gets raped. If you don&#8217;t want to have sex then you just say no.&#8221; But the fact that the man was two hundred and fifty pounds and the woman was a hundred had nothing to do with it. So there was a lot of denial of inequities, physical strength and intimidation, and then the women often felt so guilty and so dirty. All she wanted to do was forget it, and so there was not much follow-up for the mental health [treatment]. So as the next project that I worked on, as clinic supervisor at the Sexual Assault Center, which was an agency designed specifically to work with women and children. [The] women that had been sexually assaulted or had been sexually abused as children and were still dealing with the trauma. So I ran a group for nine years for women that had been sexually assaulted or had reoccurring memories. The whole memory thing got really to be an issue. And then, of course, I had staff that worked with children that had been abused, a lot of play therapy and those kinds of things. JW: And what year did you start that? RJ: Oh gosh. I left Child and Family in &#8217;86-no, I started in private practice in &#8217;86. I left Child and Family in &#8217;84. I went with Overlook Mental Health Center for a couple years and then I went in private practice. And when I went in private practice in &#8217;86, then that&#8217;s when I associated also with the Sexual Assault Center. There was three of us on staff, four on staff at the time and so I was the clinical supervisor and then we started adding staff. I was there for fifteen years on some level. JW: So how were you learning to counsel people through this when, like you said, rape didn&#8217;t exist? You were part of that movement to say, &#8220;Wait a second. It does.&#8221; RJ: It does exist and it has more than physical impact on the victim. Well, how were we learning that? Well, learning how to be a counselor, quote, therapist. Counseling usually is around solving problems, defining problems and solving problems in a real sort of one, two, three way. That&#8217;s my definition. Now therapy is a much longer and more in-depth look at how you reacted to the problem on an emotional level and what that did to your mental health. What has it done? Do you find yourself depressed, staying in bed all day long, or continuing to get into self-destructive, abusive relationships? That takes a long time to figure out how to break those patterns and we&#8217;re now learning a whole lot more about the brain. If I had time to go, I&#8217;d be a neurologist. I would study that and how to educate people to train their brain differently. We know that can happen now. We have the technology, and we have the expertise. But anyway, back to how do you learn how to deal with somebody about a behavior or an event that supposedly doesn&#8217;t happen. (laughs) Well, the first thing you do is say, &#8220;It does happen.&#8221; And again, since we&#8217;re products of our culture, you have to do a lot of work on yourself, or at least I did, in saying, &#8220;Yeah, that happens and yes, it&#8217;s not good and yes, most of the victims are women, but also little boys get raped and vulnerable males also get raped.&#8221; So you have to sort of retrain your own thinking about that and disconnect yourself from the common belief system. It has some service in the community to deny certain things and so you have to figure out, okay, if I rock the boat, what happens? What role do I play? It&#8217;s like the whole thing with women, the women&#8217;s movement. There was this thought that women, you can have it all. You can&#8217;t have it all. You have to make choices. You can&#8217;t be the CEO of a multimillion-dollar corporation and be there every time your kid has a fever. You can&#8217;t do it. So you make choices.References 3-4 - 5.89% CoverageRJ: Well, how has it been slow to change? JW: Or has it been? Has this mostly been a positive story of success? RJ: Well, in some ways for some people it has. I think there&#8217;s still a lot of, and I&#8217;m thinking of just a great influence on people&#8217;s attitudes on sex generally and then, concomitant of that, the misuse of sex to control somebody, which is essentially [abuse]. Rape is not about sex. It&#8217;s about violence and control, because if you want to have good sex, you don&#8217;t rape. And sexual overtures to a child essentially, those people, in my humble opinion, do not have power any place else or they don&#8217;t feel powerful in any place else. So it&#8217;s not about the use of your sexual self for pleasure or for connection. It&#8217;s about violence, psychological violence if not physical violence, on another person. So how have we changed? I&#8217;m not so sure that television and popular media doesn&#8217;t sometimes glorify non-consensual sex and it certainly, I don&#8217;t think, creates enough distaste for prostitution and those areas that females get entrapped maybe. I know that some of your audience would probably say, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s choice there too.&#8221; Anyway, so we&#8217;ve both been changing toward appreciation for the individual and individual choice and for women, but we&#8217;ve also degraded, to some degree, the whole process of sexuality and made it entertainment and/or a power play. It&#8217;s kind of sad in a lot of ways. I&#8217;m at the age where I don&#8217;t want to sound like a curmudgeon and blah blah blah blah, the world&#8217;s going to the dogs, but I have spent my whole career, adult life, advocating for women and for choice and for equality in all arenas. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve got there yet. What is real discouraging at times is to see women who get power and also become abusive and not nice, not helpful, not nurturing. We know of those folks. That&#8217;s really sad. So maybe it&#8217;s the power in the human family that&#8217;s the culprit, not necessarily discrimination based on male-female, but it&#8217;s on the power group versus the un-empowered. It&#8217;s possible for us to destroy ourselves as a species. So have we made progress? I don&#8217;t know, but the human community is very slow. Again, I think our brain is slow to change. And once we get an idea, it&#8217;s very hard to change back and say, &#8220;Hmm, maybe, maybe the best place for children is not eight to ten hours a day in daycare.&#8221; <Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Kurth_Suzanne_B_(Suzanne_Beth)> - § 1 reference coded  [7.92% Coverage]Reference 1 - 7.92% CoverageSK: That&#8217;s been really tough. There were a couple things that we had to work on in a variety of ways. One of them was language, okay, so that one&#8212;. Let&#8217;s see. We did that through the Commission for Women, so the Commission for Women in that case, we proposed some language guidelines and we got Chancellor Reese to agree to append them to the faculty handbook, because we wanted to have some place that we could point to and say you need to use gender neutral language. I&#8217;m coming to sexual harassment, but actually what you might think would be harder, we got that first that way. On the sexual harassment thing, I was on a committee of the AEP [Affirmative Employment Program] and we looked at policies at various schools and drafted one, and that&#8217;s probably dated in the 1980s, and again that&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve got and that&#8217;s become an issue. Okay, so at least we got something done, and it was that we were not successful, let&#8217;s say, in getting the administration to put one in but we could come in the back way and say we&#8217;re proposing this, so it&#8217;s coming from the side, if you will. Then you&#8217;d encounter all these people saying things like, &#8220;But that&#8217;s how I met my wife. That&#8217;s how I met my husband. You&#8217;re denying us the opportunity.&#8221; [Laughs] Well just keep your pants zipped up and wait a little while. It&#8217;ll work. JF: [Laughs] SK: But you can&#8217;t say those things. So Cheryl Travis and I have been talking about updating that policy because she&#8217;s been working on some stuff in the psychology department and I&#8217;ve been trying to get the AEP to retake it up as an issue, to update it and make it more powerful, because what it is, is it&#8217;s very weak. It&#8217;s a weak statement as it's written because that&#8217;s what we could get accepted, but ultimately you have to be strategically political. It&#8217;s better to have something that you can build on than have nothing. It doesn&#8217;t have enough clout in it, if you will. So, yeah, that&#8217;s one of our current projects, is to try and do that, and Cheryl [Travis] and I have published together on sexual harassment. It&#8217;s been a topic of interest. Certainly in the field of psychology it&#8217;s rampant. [Laughs] I mean in that professors exploiting graduate women has been talked about for decades and continues. JF: What was the resistance to a stronger sexual harassment policy? SK: Well it always starts from the kind of thing of sort of denying people the right to meet other people, as I said: That&#8217;s how I met my husband; that&#8217;s how I met my wife. That I think underneath it all is the idea of, you know, sort of like with rape, that there&#8217;d be false accusation, that there&#8217;d be misunderstandings. But overall institutions are not keen on dealing with sexual harassment, so I spent eight or nine years as the ombudsperson for students on campus and obviously encountered students who had various problems, and I discovered that the institution basically wants them to go away, okay. So they don&#8217;t want there to be action taken against somebody for sexual harassment; they want them to leave, or the student to leave, or whatever, okay, because that&#8217;s the whole problem with a lot of the policies that you have to sort of protect people, is that the institution&#8217;s really at heart trying to protect itself and so they&#8217;re not going to be supportive of things that would ever sort of make it public or lead to lawsuits or whatever. So, yeah, that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s not stronger policies.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Leeper_Connie> - § 2 references coded  [0.63% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.63% Coverage No, there werenÃ¢Â€Â™t.

You look at male newscasters, they&#8217;re all up there with suits and ties and looking all put together and you see women newscasters and they&#8217;re in all kinds of revealing clothes, skirts up to here, and I don&#8217;t get it. I don&#8217;t know what this means or how one is supposed to think of these women. There was a situation on the news not too long ago; I think it was in Boston, up east someplace. A woman was raped and somehow managed to survive. It was intended to be a homicide. One of the newscasters, like an idiot, asked the sheriff, how can women protect themselves from this kind of random violence, and he said stop dressing like sluts. And of course the national media, CNN, went bananas; here we go, blaming the victim again. He apologized and retracted his statement, but there was a kernel of truth there which he should have figured out a better way to talk about. There is an element of you&#8217;ve got to stop dressing provocatively if you&#8217;re going into a bar in a seedy side of town. I&#8217;m very conscious of the fact that my granddaughter, she wants to be a princess. She idolizes these popular singers, these women who could just as well be standing up there stark naked as far as I&#8217;m concerned. So I have mixed feelings about it, and yes we did always look put together when we went to class, but I&#8217;m not entirely comfortable with women&#8217;s fashions right now. I&#8217;ll put it that way. Of course I&#8217;m sure my granddaughter will win when it comes to any argument. [Laughs] But I would have to admit that I guess I grew up in a pretty conservative household because I&#8217;m beginning to remember my father wouldn&#8217;t let me wear those short skirts that we used to wear to the roller rink and roller skating was a really big deal when I was growing up and I just thought that was terrible. I just wouldn&#8217;t go if I couldn&#8217;t dress like everybody else. Then of course you become aware of how much young people want to be just like everybody else. They don&#8217;t want to be different. But I&#8217;m uneasy about modern fashion, I will say that, and I&#8217;m not blaming the victim; I&#8217;m just saying be smart. On the other hand, being smart means knowing how to take care of your self I think, and I won&#8217;t go any further.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Levy_Dianne> - § 12 references coded  [10.84% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.50% CoverageSo we went to England where I had family in London, my father&#8217;s family was still there, and I found a cottage, just a little thatched roof cottage, in a little village outside of Cambridge and that&#8217;s where I recovered, really, from that Valium stuff that was just--. I mean so many women were addicted to Valium back in the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s. It&#8217;s just amazing to me. It&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re pissed off? Here, take this.

It was a good building and they were going to tear this building down, but they weren&#8217;t going to tear it down for two years. But they evicted everybody. So I had opened the building up and then I came back, probably I guess it must have been sixteen hours later, and my next job was the supply person so I was going through--. Because somebody else had moved all these families in and so my job was to--. And they couldn&#8217;t leave. You had to occupy it totally for thirty days and then all this legal stuff came in and you could pretty much be there for the year. So I began going up and down and visiting all the people in these apartments to see what they needed, diapers, food, whatever it was they needed. It turned out that all the people that had moved in were women, some hd kids, no men were in the building, and they were all, God, they were Cambridge fellows and they were all academics. So I was visiting these women and I was making a delivery and there was this one woman in there and--I was so young and so na&#239;ve--I asked her--. She was covered in something and I thought it was a rash, she had stuff all over her body. I&#8217;d just gotten into herbs a little bit so I asked her if she wanted me to bring her something for her rash, did she want some comfrey, I had comfrey, or I had, you know. She looked at me like the idiot I was and she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a rash,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Well, gosh, what--?&#8221; Bruises. Every one of those women was a battered woman, every one of them, every one. So that was my first like, whoa. If I&#8217;d had any preconceptions about women that were hurt, raped, that really knocked--. Because I&#8217;m sure I was like everybody else and I just sort of assumed everybody was poor or uneducated or something, somebody other than me. Every one of us wants to believe that a woman who&#8217;s being victimized in some way is someone other than us. It&#8217;s a terrible thing to realize that that&#8217;s not true, that all of us are potential victims and you can&#8217;t tell somebody by looking at them and you can&#8217;t tell a man who would hurt you by looking at him and we&#8217;re all vulnerable, every one of us.

I&#8217;m the real thing now, but I wasn&#8217;t then. She was very helpful to me and taught me a lot of good stuff and we worked in each other&#8217;s fields. Let me tell you this; this is an important story. So, I don&#8217;t know if you know Grassy Fork or that area. Back thirty or forty years ago&#8212;all the roads back in there are paved now, which amuses me since my road isn&#8217;t paved and that&#8217;s much more of a road&#8212;but it was really a remote section of the county and it was very rough roads. Nothing was paved back in there, which made me happy. I was happy to disappear into the woods. At the fork of the road I lived on there was a cement block building which was probably maybe the size of like the front of the house to the end of the house, maybe thirty feet long and maybe sixteen feet wide. It had a back door and it had a front door and it had two front windows and that was it. There was nothing to it. I was coming out one day and I saw Johnnie&#8217;s truck parked there so I stopped and looked in and there she was, and I said, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; because she had a farm and four kids and she had a son-of-a-bitch for a husband, too. Oh, [Laughs] and I had done the same thing with Johnnie Ray one day. I was out at her place or she&#8217;d come down to me and Johnnie had all this stuff all over her arms, and I said, &#8220;Johnnie, have you got ringworm or did you run into some poison, or what&#8217;s going on with you?&#8221; She looked at me like I was really an idiot and she said, &#8220;Those are bruises.&#8221; It turns out that her husband, Paul was just--. He was a drunk and he was the kind that used drink as an excuse and I mean he raped and pillaged and beat. I&#8217;m sure he raped all of his kids, not to mention Johnnie, and beat her and the kids to a bloody pulp time and time again. Also, lucky for me, he was also a cop fighter so that was greatly in our favor because he fought cops and cops don&#8217;t like cop fighters. Anyway, I&#8217;d already found out about the bruising and when I stopped at that building that day and said, &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; she said, &#8220;That&#8217;s a steel door, steel door, got bars over both those windows, and he can&#8217;t burn this building.&#8221; And so she rented that little building probably for about thirty bucks a month, I don&#8217;t know, not much. I don&#8217;t know if there was an outhouse there. It was electric, there was an electric line and she had a refrigerator. She had a little counter not as big as this table and on the counter she had like two loaves of light bread and three onions and some bananas and some Beanie Weenies or something. That was her stock from the store. [Sighs] Many a night Johnnie would run out of the house, grab the kids, and she&#8217;d lock herself in that building, many, many a night. So, it was Christmas day 1975, probably 2:00 in the afternoon maybe, and I had a call. It was Gracie, one of her daughters, and I guess Gracie was nine. She said, &#8220;Mama says come quick.&#8221; So I jumped in my little VW bug, and she lived probably, I don&#8217;t know, maybe five miles up the mountain from me. I got up there in time and there was a deputy up there. So Christmas Eve they&#8217;d finished the tree and got all the presents out and they were waiting for Paul to come home, and he never came home that night. The next morning they waited for him to come home all morning to open presents and he didn&#8217;t come home. They went ahead and opened presents, and they waited and waited on Christmas dinner for him to come home and he didn&#8217;t come home, and they'd been up all night, so they eat Christmas dinner early and they ate dinner, and she had fallen asleep. Johnnie had fallen asleep on the couch and she woke up and he was standing over her with a knife at her throat saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re going to die, bitch.&#8221; Johnnie was a strong woman, she&#8217;d been fighting him for years, and he was drunk, and so they struggled and struggled and struggled. And Gracie went into the bedroom and got the pistol that Johnnie kept loaded under her pillow, because it wasn&#8217;t the first time this had happened, and Gracie threw the pistol across the room, tossed it across the room to Johnnie--I mean you can just imagine it, screaming [1:02:24]--and Johnnie caught the pistol and it went off. Now he&#8217;s got the--I mean he&#8217;s after her with the knife. The bullet slices right through here and gets his--aorta? Is that what it is? And so he was bleeding to death. She called the law and called the ambulance and blah, blah, blah, but he died. I got up there in time. The ambulance had just left and the deputy was just waiting for me to get up there so I could keep the kids so they could haul her off, and they hauled her off to jail, Christmas day, hauled her off to jail, charged her with first degree murder, manslaughter. I think they released her late that night because I think we had the kids back to her the next day. So she was charged with murder, and she was convicted of murder, even though it was clearly self defense. They didn&#8217;t think anything about convicting her for murder, and then they let her go. And they laughed about it because Paul was a cop fighter and he&#8217;d had big fights with the cops for years and they hated him and he was always dangerous to them, too. They would make jokes about it: &#8220;Good going, Johnnie!&#8221; and stuff like that. Well she was devastated. I mean the more you suffer the more emotional attachment you have. They&#8217;d been abused for years horribly, but that desn&#8217;t mean the emotional attachment isn&#8217;t there. It was horrible for her, convicted of murdering her husband who she hated and loved, and being joked about at the courthouse about, &#8220;Good going,&#8221; you know, &#8220;That&#8217;s great!&#8221; They&#8217;d pat her on the back; horrible. I discovered in that time that there were no laws [Laughs] to protect family members. Basically a man could assault his family at will, rape, beat, terrorize, whatever he wanted to do, and the law and the preachers and everybody went, oh, well that&#8217;s his business.References 7-8 - 0.76% Coverage DL: I was just responding to a need, which is what I did, and that meant that not only was I sheltering people but I had already set up an underground railroad of sorts.

They had accused this black of raping a woman, or something, one of those episodes, and they ran every black out of the county, took over their farms and whatever and they had to move. I was told stories about how they hung blacks around the courthouse. I know they at least lynched the guy that they were accusing of this, and I don&#8217;t know how many others. Some people maybe have done some research on it, but the stories were told. I could just see bodies hanging all around the courthouse in my mind as to what happened. So it was kind of a really [pause] horror. And then blacks coming in through the town on trucks to deliver stuff to the stores were afraid to get out of the truck. They would hide in the back of the truck. I found this to be just horrifying, but somehow I never quite got it connected with doing anything about it or thinking about it in that way. My father came home from the mail route one day, and he said he saw this old black man bicycling through town and he was on his way to Gainesville. And he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m worried he&#8217;s got to go through Chestatee because that&#8217;s where the--.&#8221; The young Chestatee boys were the ones that started the riot. They threw all the blacks out, the rowdy boys of Chestatee. He said, &#8220;He&#8217;ll never make it to Gainesville,&#8221; so he gets in his car and he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go find him.&#8221; So he goes and picks him up and takes him to Gainesville and comes back, so there was that little bit of episode. Then this teacher comes to town--and I was telling that story when the storm hit--who had this black woman who was a companion, maid, person who&#8217;d always been in their family. And she taught music and the woman lived with her, and the boys from Chestatee came with torches and surrounded her house and made her get up in the middle of the night and take the black woman back to Alabama.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Mashburn_Lillian_Tauxe> - § 2 references coded  [2.95% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.95% Coverage LM: I think one of the things that&#8217;s interested me is how men began to change attitudes as their daughters graduated from college and started looking for jobs. I saw a sea change in attitude because their girls were facing what a lot of the rest of us had faced. I think it became clear that the path was not get a college degree, get married, and have babies. So I think there became a change that started in the late [19]70s and continued. I&#8217;m proud of what we did. I am very disgusted, angry, frustrated over what I see is part of a religious-seeming religious, I guess, I don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s all coming from-of trying to put the genie back in the bottle, trying to put women back into--. And they&#8217;re using Roe v. Wade and birth control and all. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a generational situation where people are fearful, but I feel like some of the things that we accomplished, we&#8217;re losing. I mean, to pass a bill that requires the IRS to look into the tax situation of women who have been raped, there&#8217;s something sick going on. When Congress is spending all this time and our state legislature all this time on all of these non-issues, it&#8217;s like the war on women. That&#8217;s what some people are calling it, and I think that&#8217;s very accurate. I think the war on teachers is almost a war on women. You espouse education as important and, yet, you&#8217;re trying to take rights away from teachers. I don&#8217;t get it. So I&#8217;m very angry about that because I think we&#8217;re trying to step back to a time--. And people keep talking about, oh, how it was in the [19]50s. Well, bullshit. (laughs) The &#8217;50s were not the be [all] and [end] all. I think women were stuck in family situations. They didn&#8217;t have the independence to get out of abusive situations. There was no women&#8217;s crisis center, women&#8217;s sexual assault center. There was no support network in that era. <Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_McNabb_Bernadette> - § 1 reference coded  [1.39% Coverage]Reference 1 - 1.39% CoverageBM: No, I&#8217;ve never considered myself a feminist counselor and I&#8217;m not sure what exactly that-.

BM: I think that with the Sexual Assault Crisis Center there tends to be more of an anger, and I think it&#8217;s well-founded in that somebody has been violated to that extreme.

And my recollection is that the federal funding for the abortion issue was in cases of rape or threatened life of the mother. One of my concerns here in North Carolina was not only rape and risk of life of the mother, but incest. I felt that as long as it was legally right for the wealthy women to have abortions, that it should be legally right for poor women to have abortions. Poor women who could afford another mouth to feed even less than the rich, and so I persuaded the legislature to appropriate some state funds for abortions so that--. For example, thirteen, fourteen-year-old girls who got pregnant, and sometimes it was incest in the family, and they had no business first of all in getting pregnant, but they didn&#8217;t have control over it because its usually the male in the family who has control there. And secondly, they should not be forced to have a baby at that young age. So I thought we needed to have some state funds to abort these youngsters. And so the legislature, even though many of them were very opposed to abortion, they still felt that, you know--. They felt, I think, the same as I did, that to force a teenager to have a pregnancy and carry it through and have a baby that she was not able to take care of was not an appropriate thing to have happen. So our legislature, as I recall, appropriated two-hundred-thousand dollars in state funds for abortions for poor women, which would cover, of course, incest, rape, and risk of life of the mother, just as the federal government did, but it might cover some other situations where the pregnancy existed and was not needed nor wanted. It&#8217;s a shame that we can&#8217;t prevent unwanted pregnancies altogether, but the sex drive apparently is such a strong one for procreation that it alters behavior, especially if alcohol or any other kinds of drugs are involved. So I think it&#8217;s much more desirable to prevent unwanted pregnancies than it is to have to deal with them after pregnancy has occurred. DONNALLY: How did you go about convincing or proposing--? Was it just kind of a backroom consensus that the legislators didn&#8217;t think that teenage girls should be having to carry [a pregnancy to term](0:48:29)? MORROW: No, it was--. I&#8217;m sure I discussed this with people in the appropriations committee and explained my views of what I was dealing with and what I was seeing because in the health department itself, I had dealt with girls who&#8217;d come in and they were pregnant. Maybe they had arranged through some private enterprise to have an abortion, and then they&#8217;d come back in wanting to get contraceptives and I&#8217;d explain they&#8217;ll have to go and get their mother&#8217;s or father&#8217;s--. They have to have parental consent to even have contraceptives. So I think these were things that I discussed with the legislature, that so often we put so many barriers up because as the girls would tell me, &#8220;You know, my parents don&#8217;t give a damn.&#8221; And that always disturbed me that the parents could not care enough about their children to make sure that they were preventing an unwanted pregnancy. And here the girls were trying to look after themselves and I&#8217;d have to get parental consent for them to have contraceptives. That just didn&#8217;t make sense to me. So we discussed a number of legislative issues. I do know that as time went on, the two hundred thousand dollars, I know was reduced at least fifty thousand dollars because there were objections to abortions being made available through state funds. And I think ultimately the fifty thousand was omitted from the budget, but the legislators at that time were very willing to listen and they were open-minded on so many things rather than just having already pre-decided what they felt. [Brief interruption due to phone call.] DONNALLY: We were talking about attempts to provide contraception and contraception to teenagers. MORROW: [Unintelligible due to lack of microphone] DONNALLY: Oh, would you put your microphone back on? MORROW: The family planning programs in our local health departments, our county health departments do an excellent job of providing means for people who do not want a pregnancy to avoid those pregnancies. I think that in itself has lowered both maternal mortality and infant mortality by providing contraceptives to those people who are not able to or disabled or are not in a financial position to afford pregnancy.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Parsons_Darlene> - § 4 references coded  [13.68% Coverage]References 1-2 - 12.40% Coverage So my faith was becoming more and more strong as I sought, and I also became more comfortable with a little doubt on the edges, because all of us doubt, and I also believe God&#8217;s big enough to handle our doubt. So what happened was a woman came to my house and said, &#8220;I need to tell you a story.&#8221; She said, &#8220;My son&#8211;.&#8221; We had heard that a pedophile who was associated with Providence Baptist had been arrested &#8211; and by the way he&#8217;s serving thirteen years &#8211; and that he had molested a fair number of young teen boys, and he had been a volunteer [from the] seminary and he worked with all the youth. EF: The seminary in Raleigh? DP: Yeah, Southeastern Seminary. I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean to&#8211;. EF: Oh, that&#8217;s okay. DP: Assume Southeastern when I talk about more fundamentalism, alright? EF: Okay, got it. DP: That might help. EF: Sure. DP: He molested kids, and I found out how bad, and I wanted to tell you that, as a nurse who had worked with child sex abuse victims, this was amongst some of the worst sexual abuse I have ever heard in my life. I can&#8217;t even speak of it, it makes me so sick. This young man, who was fourteen at the time, and his name is Aaron &#8211; he&#8217;s veryout about his name &#8211; was at a summer camp and the guy, he was in a cabin with him, and the guy &#8211; and forgive me if this is X-rated &#8211; was encouraging them to do circle masturbation. He was shocked. He&#8217;s fourteen years old. He went to the pastors and told them this, this is a year before the arrest, and they decided not to believe him. They said he was exaggerating and that this seminary student &#8211; Doug Goodrich, he was in the news &#8211; that Doug said, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s locker room humor. This is what we were doing and he&#8217;s exaggerating it.&#8221; His parents came in and met with them and they ignored it and, not only then, but then he was actually put on probation for six weeks, the parents weren&#8217;t told, because he was taking them to some pretty explicit R-rated movies and a parent discovered it. So they told the church that he was taking a six-week sabbatical to help care of his sick mother but in fact it was due to that. He came back and he was escalating, and it was a policeman&#8211;. He took a kid after church to a park and was molesting him in a car and was found by a policeman, so we know that this all happened. I was in absolute shock, and I went to the pastors and I said, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you do something a year ago? This is bad behavior.&#8221; They denied that the meeting ever took place. They said, &#8220;No, the kid didn&#8217;t report this.&#8221; That&#8217;s when I realized something was wrong. The mother was a friend of mine, I knew her through the school and stuff, and I watched her as she talked to me, and I knew when she was telling me the story, and I was watching her hands shake, that I knew my life was about to change forever. I knew that I was stepping into something that I couldn&#8217;t come back from, but I didn&#8217;t know quite what it was. I called a friend who taught Sunday school with us and I said, &#8220;You&#8217;re a deacon, you do something about it.&#8221; He goes, &#8220;Well, I thought it was all dealt with.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, you claim that you believe all this stuff in the Bible. You can&#8217;t let this go.&#8221; He said that that was a moment that changed his life forever, that I held his feet to the fire. We got a group of people together and confronted the church. The church did an investigation and claimed that the meeting never took place and that they didn&#8217;t know anything about it, and we knew that it had taken place. We had people who remember when it all occurred and so forth. We left the church, and the Bible study that we founded with our Sunday school class, the day we walked out &#8211; we told the class we had to leave and we were very frank about it &#8211; that class was decimated, and our friends all went to different churches but we still get together twice a month for a Bible study. We&#8217;ve been together for years, and the young man gave me a gift that I will never forget because I believed him. I was at a party and he came up to me and said, &#8220;I got this for you,&#8221; and it was those little Willow Creek&#8211;. Have you seen those little angel carvings? They&#8217;re made of wood. You see them in the Hallmark stores. EF: Oh, yeah. DP: And it was the Angel of Courage, and her hands are raised like that, and he said, &#8220;You gave up everything, your church, your Sunday school class, because you believed me.&#8221; And he is a very, very healthy young man today but he was headed down a tough path. So I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s it, I&#8217;m starting a blog. I&#8217;m going to start writing about a lot of things that have been troubling me for a long time,&#8221; and my husband made me promise&#8211;. He said he wouldn&#8217;t do it again, but my husband and my friend&#8217;s husband were worried that we were going to get in trouble, we were going to get sued, and I can understand why they felt that way. So they asked us, in the incident that happened at that church, not to write about it directly, so we did a series called &#8220;Leaving Wonderland&#8221; and we wrote about what happened but gave names to the characters, like &#8220;Alice&#8221; and so forth. EF: Sure. DP: The church was mad at us, they actually got some lawyers, however Jeff Anderson, who is&#8211;. If you look him up on Wiki he&#8217;s the one responsible for most of the settlements against the Catholic Church. He heard about what we did and he called me, he called and talked to me on the phone, and he said, &#8220;I just want to let you know, they can throw you out of the church but they can&#8217;t bring you to court. You&#8217;ve done nothing wrong. If you need me, I&#8217;ll fly in and tell them.&#8221; So he then helped me to understand what I can say and what I can&#8217;t say. EF: Sure. DP: So we began writing, we wrote about that. Then Mark Driscoll&#8211;. EF: And this is the Wartburg Watch, right? DP: Yes, and we named it after the castle that they had Martin Luther in when the pope was trying to&#8211;. EF: And what year did you begin this? DP: 2009. EF: Okay. DP: And nobody read us at first, except for people affiliated with the church who wanted to see if they could get any dirt. EF: Right. DP: We were very careful about what we said. But we also didn&#8217;t like a lot of other people. Mark Driscoll was very famous, Mars Hill, and if you look at him, he just had to step down, but he was big. We wrote [about him and] we called it &#8220;Brother Mark&#8217;s Traveling Sex Show.&#8221; He came here to UNC campus and we wrote about&#8211;. I mean, he&#8217;s pretty gruesome, and I don&#8217;t&#8211;. It&#8217;s almost hard to talk about some of the things he said as well, about women, as really&#8211;. Well, I mean everyone&#8217;s written about it in the papers, in the New York Times. He called &#8220;penis humps.&#8221; EF: Wow. DP: Yeah. I mean this was stuff that was going on, and we couldn&#8217;t believe it because all of the Neo-Calvinist crowd, they were loving this Mark Driscoll who was into this manly stuff, and my friend and I, we&#8217;re no one. We&#8217;re just like average people. She has an MBA, by the way, from Carolina. We&#8217;re average people and we&#8217;re looking at everything we&#8217;re seeing, and we talked to some pastors at Southeastern, seminarians, and they&#8217;re saying, &#8220;You don&#8217;t get it. We all support them and there&#8217;s something wrong with the two of you.&#8221; Well, Mark Driscoll just stepped down, so maybe we weren&#8217;t so stupid after all. We&#8217;re average nobodies. So I said, &#8220;Look, let&#8217;s get our thoughts out on the table. Let&#8217;s start writing.&#8221; So the first year a few people trickled in. Well, we are still in absolute shock, because then people started sharing their stories. So we started posting their stories at this church and that church, and now, this morning, I had a little technical glitch and a guy in Perth, Australia said, &#8220;I see your glitch. Here&#8217;s how you take care of it.&#8221; I&#8217;ve got a guy in Perth, Australia, and there&#8217;s even a gal who works during the summer months in Antarctica who follows us, and we have people in England and Scotland who are regulars on our blog, and we continue to go after child sex abuse. This was a big deal for us and there are so&#8211;. Boz Tchividjian, who is Billy Graham&#8217;s grandson, he got into this too and he said that the evangelical church is in worse shape than the Catholic Church when it comes to child sex abuse, and he&#8217;s formed a group called GRACE which is exposing child sex abuse in the evangelical church. And he&#8217;s right, because if you look at the statistics you have like a billion adherents in the Catholic Church. If you look at it percentage wise we are higher than the Catholic Church when it comes to not handling child sex abuse, pedophilia, and so forth. EF: But Catholic abuses are much more in the media. DP: Yes, although it&#8217;s starting, because we now are&#8211;. We were very involved in exposing the Sovereign Grace Ministries sex abuse cover-up, which we believe is a cover-up, and it is probably the biggest lawsuit that has been brought against one entity within the evangelical population. We were writing about that right from the start as well. A group of families have brought lawsuits against Sovereign Grace Ministries and it&#8217;s going to be a long battle in the courts. References 3-4 - 1.28% CoverageThis guy was the head of the whole thing and he was very entrenched in the Neo-Calvinist movement, C. J. Mahaney and Sovereign Grace. So Todd went into the bookstore and said, &#8220;They&#8217;re pushing C. J. Mahaney&#8217;s books. I&#8217;ve met a couple of those kids who were abused. I know some of those families. We should not have this man&#8217;s books in our bookstore,&#8221; and he told them, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to become a member of the leadership until you get rid of these books. I can&#8217;t in good conscience support this. To me child sex abuse is a horrendous blot on the church,&#8221; and they said no, and in fact they push&#8211;. They quote C. J. Mahaney a lot in the services. So he said, &#8220;That&#8217;s it, I&#8217;m out of here. I&#8217;m not going to be a member of this church,&#8221; except he signed a membership covenant, and this is something that we talk about at length. These membership covenants are actually legal. They can be legally enforced.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Pevia_Kim_Adrienne> - § 2 references coded  [5.37% Coverage]Reference 1 - 3.40% CoverageCognitive dissonance when you have to break from what you believed for a long time is painful, and I went through it myself. I have crazy stories. I was molested in the back of a church as a child by a person who then came out and spoke in tongues, and there was a message delivered. So you can imagine the stories that I told to myself, and this happened for a long time as a child when I would come here for summers. And yet something deep always wooed me to be healed. Whether it was walking by the rivers or just quiet. I say I am as comfortable in a Holy Ghost-filled church service as I am a camp meeting, as I am an ashram as I am with my Jewish friends at synagogue, as I am on my patio because it&#8217;s not about the process or the path to that place. It&#8217;s about the place itself. And so that&#8217;s what I find is so interesting about me then coming back here and helping build these bridges between in these different places. Because as I was going through my own healing process I can remember what it was like for me to break away from what I had been taught traditionally and how it was so deeply disturbing that many times I called out, &#8220;Please help me to understand.&#8221; Because some of the things I now believe I was taught back then were evil. And yet there was something deep inside me that was stirring me, and it didn&#8217;t feel bad; it felt good, and so I would cry out and again the chills of, &#8220;Help me understand.&#8221; The words of &#8220;I am the same God&#8221; keep coming to me all the time. They get dropped in my spirit. &#8220;I am the same God. I am the same God.&#8221; So I live and operate from that place and offer that to those who are open to hear it because there are some we know will never be swayed. There are some who are looking for help out of that thing because they&#8217;re having questions too. And there are some that are like, &#8220;Oh yeah, I&#8217;m there.&#8221; So I work in the &#8220;Oh yeah, I&#8217;m there and I can be swayed,&#8221; and the rest--that might be the next generation&#8217;s work or they may never be or they might be the thing against we have to push so we get our chrysalis muscle. I don&#8217;t know, but I try to stay in that space and have enough courage to speak my piece, but most truth and most love is really important to me versus taking a bat and trying to shatter people&#8217;s belief systems. Because I felt my own cognitive dissonance, and I was being wooed out of it because of my own pain. Imagine if that&#8217;s not true for somebody else, and I&#8217;m trying to get them to try to see something different.Reference 2 - 1.98% CoverageYes. Yes. I would&#8217;ve said [this] before I came back. [I think it helped me] very clearly understand what people here dealt with because I had been through it myself, but when I came back and still even now sometimes I&#8217;m aware it&#8217;s even deeper than what my experience was because I did get to go away. I didn&#8217;t have to see him all the time. For people here, especially the women many times go to church with or have family reunions with people that have hurt them the most and not only around issues of sexual violence but domestic violence or even [that] your father stole the land of my father. I say that we swim and poop and eat all in the same water. Then we have to run into each other at Food Lion and Wal-Mart. Even now I feel I know I&#8217;m reckoning with things and that reckoning I use to have compassion and empathy for what others must be going through and at the same time know we can&#8217;t stay stuck there. That is the path. That is the journey. That is the role, to continue to move beyond that in ways not just numbly, blindly saying it&#8217;s okay. But finding deep forgiveness. And forgiveness does not have to mean restoration. We don&#8217;t have to allow that to occur again but [we have] to move beyond the stuck places. Yes, without a doubt, the modalities that I use in practice, I would never have learned had I stayed here. And it&#8217;s hard, I still am very selective who I share those with. But I&#8217;m feeling a deeper willing to talk about them in much larger ways.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Pharr_Suzanne> - § 9 references coded  [5.03% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.45% Coverage I had worked a lot around rape in New Orleans. There was a woman named Francis Woods, a great feminist in Fayetteville, had gone--I can&#8217;t remember where she went to school now, somewhere in the Northeast; I think maybe Rutgers, but I&#8217;m not sure, but she had studied there. This was 1976. In getting her degree, she had studied domestic violence. It was being brought up then in an academic and a public way, mainly out of England. And so she came back and she pulled a bunch of us together and she said, &#8220;There&#8217;s this thing that&#8217;s happening around that country and it&#8217;s been happening forever. It&#8217;s that women are getting raped and beaten within their own marriages. We were like basically, &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; I mean, it really was such a&#8230; JD: &#8230;It was an unspeakable crime. SP: Yeah, and we had gotten rape and understood rape, but gotten the idea of that and had a lot of politics around that, but this was so hidden and so unspeakable. So we started organizing together and the group of us developed this battered women&#8217;s shelter, and there were three women who were academics at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville who took out the loan to buy us a house. We ran it off volunteer workers and CETA, and I became the chair of the board as an out lesbian. References 3-4 - 0.79% CoverageWhat&#8217;s always lost when you don&#8217;t put people who are most directly affected by the issue, that you don&#8217;t put them at the heart of the organization and the leadership of the organization, enormous things are lost. You get closer to charity; you get closer to doing for rather than, &#8220;We are,&#8221; rather than, &#8220;We&#8217;re all battered women,&#8221; the identity, and the person might be one minute off or one day off from being a rape victim. You often lose connection to community. The biggest failure of the battered women&#8217;s movement has been our failure to organize women who have come through a shelter. A lot of that has come from a failure to identify across class and across race. References 5-6 - 0.31% CoverageSo, we created the State Domestic Violence Coalition, and then we moved on from that. We were the folks who first began talking about incest in a political way and do training on that. We&#8217;d send film out on buses into rural communities for people to be able to do their own training. Reference 7 - 1.46% CoverageSo, as we worked with monitoring the--I&#8217;m a little bit jumping about here, but I do have a train of thought, monitoring the right, the far right, we came increasingly to recognize that that wasn&#8217;t what people were most concerned with. We found that what people were most concerned with was the everyday acts of racial and gender injustice and homophobic violence and religious violence. So, we created this thing called the Women&#8217;s Watchcare Network, which was funded by the United Methodist Women out of New York, which was a nice thing. So we were going to monitor all of the sexist violence and that, of course, was impossible. We couldn&#8217;t monitor all the violence against women, so we ended up monitoring just the deaths of women--hundreds. So we would document them, and we monitored extreme acts of racial violence and homophobic violence and religious violence and we held meetings around the state, where we would put people who had experienced religious violence and sexist violence and homophobic violence in the same room and talk to each other. What people discovered is their experience was very, very similar. They could, out of that, bring analysis, understand the connection of that violence--racist, sexist, homophobic and religious. What was probably the most transforming for us was the sexist violence. References 8-9 - 1.02% CoverageSo, through being attacked by the right over and over and over again--we were particularly attacked for having lesbians there, being feminist and being pro-choice and all that. We took on lots of issues that were really tough issues, like when a group of black basketball players raped a white drunk girl in Fayetteville and they were the stars. The basketball team was going to keep them from being able to go to the tournament. We were slammed, both by the black community and by the feminist community because we took a position on both, that it was wrong and also a position about what it meant to be in the state and have your--to be black and basically to be honored academically only for your bodies to be brought into the university, so we rubbed both ways. We were so viciously attacked by the press. I mean, it was enormous, the copies of the articles that were written in relation to us, and the threats that we got on that.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Prior_Karen_Swallow> - § 1 reference coded  [1.01% Coverage]Reference 1 - 1.01% CoverageThere&#8217;s a controversial article out now in a leadership journal written by a former youth pastor who is serving in prison right now for statutory rape of one of his students, so it&#8217;s very controversial because the article is overly sympathetic to his perspective. A lot of people are upset about the article, so I&#8217;ve been tweeting about&#8211;. I mean it&#8217;s this problem that people don&#8217;t understand how pervasive this problem is. And when I was in that suburban high school, my junior year my health teacher tried to seduce me and, I mean, I wasn&#8217;t interested at all. But anyway, so I have this contrast of experiences.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Radcliff_Melissa> - § 12 references coded  [10.50% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.53% Coverage I mean again [I] grew up in a small town where everybody assumed everybody&#8217;s life was fine and things like domestic violence or child abuse maybe happened in the city but didn&#8217;t happen in our town, which of course we know is not the case; References 3-4 - 1.04% Coverage In the meantime I had the chance to go run the twenty-four hour hotline at the local rape crisis center, again in Providence. Again strictly by accident there was an opportunity; I applied for it; worked for an amazing woman who encouraged me each step of the way to try new things and then had the chance to move to Phoenix and again through some networking found a similar opportunity first at a prosecutor&#8217;s office and then at a police department again working with crime victims. References 5-6 - 0.73% CoverageThat&#8217;s a little hard for me to answer because then it was so in the forefront of my brain that when I went to the rape crisis center and then went on to do other work that was such, I was responsible for training volunteers so that was such a thing from the very beginning throughout training was that you are not responsible for people. References 7-8 - 1.59% CoverageAnd there is a difference. Domestic and sexual violence agencies do have a different approach than law enforcement. They have a different role. They are part of what I see is a community response, but their role is different. There are times when victims don&#8217;t want an arrest to be made. They don&#8217;t want to press charges. They don&#8217;t want to come forward and tell their story, and for law enforcement it&#8217;s important to hear from the victim because that helps them to make their case to make an arrest and possibly prosecute. CW: Yeah. MR: So yeah. So I do think, well I know their approaches are different, and at times they can be somewhat at odds in terms of what the victim really needs at the time or somewhere down the road.References 9-10 - 4.16% Coverage I consider myself very fortunate because I feel like a lot of -- and mostly women -- but men and women fought those battles before I started. At the rape crisis center I worked with a woman who had been doing this for I can&#8217;t tell you for how long, and I mean she could tell some real horror stories about working with law enforcement and kept working at it and working on it. And when I left there, I was involved in several trainings with law enforcement where a domestic violence or a rape crisis advocate and police officer would co-train other police officers, which was huge to see that happening, and it wasn&#8217;t just I would get up and say, &#8220;This is who I am and what I do&#8221;, but we went back and forth with slides and exercises and answering questions, so that was a huge step, but again I&#8217;m fortunate that I didn&#8217;t have to get to that point. I picked it up at that point. Again [I was] fortunate in Arizona because I worked for a police force that had a whole separate domestic and sexual violence unit, whole separate building, specially trained detectives, so court--, advocates were right there. Sometimes we went onsite when a crime occurred. If not when they brought the victim back to the center, we were right there. So definitely an increased opportunity to get involved early on rather than having to wait later and having an officer realize, &#8220;Oh, I guess I probably should call someone.&#8221; This is more, but even there, there were still officers that didn&#8217;t believe victims or didn&#8217;t understand why she didn&#8217;t want to report and or didn&#8217;t, would question why she stayed for so long. The positive part of me was it was a great opportunity to remind those officers about why someone would say or why they wouldn&#8217;t want to report or why they didn&#8217;t want to go forward or why they dropped protective order. All the &#8220;why&#8221; questions we could spend some time on. References 11-12 - 2.46% Coverage Probably like everyone else, it&#8217;s funding. We&#8217;re focused right now on awareness and the advocacy piece and that&#8217;s not quite as tangible for people to think about. People want to think about how many kids did you read to and how many kids did you give transportation to and real hard concrete numbers as opposed to saying, well, what does it mean if we are presenting to the re-entry folks at public safety tomorrow or something that you might not be able to track the results from, at least not quite as direct as you can. Say we read to fifteen children last week or we did twenty tutoring session or whatever the particular situation is. So yeah, so the funding piece and [it] continues to be, it&#8217;s a tough topic, and I always think, &#8220;What can we learn from some of the other tough topics?&#8221; So what can we learn from domestic violence and child sexual abuse and cancer and death and divorce, some of those other really tough topics, some of which have a lot of political stuff around them and what did we learn from those topics, what can we continue to learn from them? And how can we apply them to issues around incarceration?<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Ray_Sylvia> - § 3 references coded  [3.59% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.27% CoverageWell I had moved to Fayetteville and had two children, and a woman that I had met through the church had been very active with the National Organization for Women. She was a minister's wife and so, of course, very non-threatening. I Sylvia Ray never really thought about it very much. And she invited me to a meeting and I immediately--I had been involved with another organization on the issue of child abuse--and I sort of immediately connected problems within families as somewhat going back to women's lack of education or power or ability to cope with issues.Reference 3 - 1.32% CoverageWe have contacts with them here in town, you know, domestic Violence center.

I went back, and it was about 1974, because then I discovered &#8211; here we go with the mass media again &#8211; I discovered in 1972 the Surgeon General&#8217;s Commission on Television Violence had completely clearly identified thousands of &#8211; I want to say three thousand&#8211; scientific studies &#8211; as if you needed scientific studies; you don&#8217;t need scientific studies &#8211; that the effects of television were disastrous. Children were becoming aggressive. Actually there was an increase in not only aggressivity but murder wherever, as the television came into the children&#8217;s lives, and yet that was not reported in the papers either. A Surgeon General&#8217;s Commission, 1972? It never saw headlines? Headlines should have been: &#8220;Television causes children to be violent. It increases rape by x percent.&#8221; It was all there, in 1972. References 3-4 - 12.55% Coverage JR: First it was just pornography, because I didn&#8217;t know the connection with child abuse. So at first &#8211; I&#8217;m going to get a copy of this? EF: Mm hmm. JR: At first, after that experience, I started doing work in the area of pornography. As I said, my thesis advisor was an addict so he had no problem with me doing research on what he&#8217;s addicted to, except he didn&#8217;t say he was addicted but he kept his magazines in his drawer at the university. Okay. Anyway, so I did some experiments, which I didn&#8217;t realize were experiments. I shouldn&#8217;t have done them. We did EKGs. We had fourteen volunteers and we got a base run and they [gave] consent. Then we showed different images, and they were definitely resonating, but I thought at the time, like other people, that that would be okay. Well it wasn&#8217;t okay, not that they complained, but it wasn&#8217;t. We did a survey of a hundred and forty-seven women about what they thought, so the conflict was always there. They would always say, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t bother me,&#8221; basically, and then you ask them questions about their sense of self and the way men look at [them] and it was in complete contrast, complete contrast. So I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Wow; this is really not good, not good.&#8221; So then, the way it led to child sex abuse, I was at my desk one day and I was going to deliver a paper &#8211; we had done a paper &#8211; on the effects of pornography on women, because that&#8217;s what it was. So I got a hold of this engineering guy &#8211; he was addicted too &#8211; and I asked him, I said, &#8220;Can I have some of your Playboys? He said, &#8220;What do you want them for?&#8221; So I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to look at them. I just want to go through them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, which ones?&#8221; because he couldn&#8217;t let go of certain ones, even for&#8211;. [Laughs] He couldn&#8217;t tell how long I was going to need them. So anyway, I got his stack and I started going through them. Well, anyway, I started going through them and flipping them, and I thought, &#8220;Did I see a kid? Did I? No.&#8221; Then I go back and, &#8220;Yeah; that&#8217;s a kid. This is a child, and this is not a good picture.&#8221; Okay, it&#8217;s a cartoon but it&#8217;s not funny, and it&#8217;s abuse. Well I thought, "Okay, that&#8217;s one. Will there be more?" So I&#8217;m flipping and there&#8217;s another one, and I&#8217;m flipping, and another one. So then I went back and started to look at the totality of the magazine and realized that Playmate has &#8211; are children they have the little pictures of children, and I&#8211;. Whoa! This is not good. There&#8217;s going to be child sexual abuse here. This is not innocent. Then my daughter was raped by the boy upstairs, who was thirteen, at which point I realized later that laws had been changed to accommodate the fact that [if] a boy of thirteen abuses a girl of ten there&#8217;s a little peer exception rule so that they can rape kids. What is this about? So all this starts to add up, and my daughter, her reaction to this rape &#8211; it was over a year until I found out &#8211; was indicative of&#8211;. And the boy had stacks of Playboy. His father collected Playboy and they were up in his closet, stacks of it, but I&#8217;d never connected all these things. I mean I knew because I knew the mother and she mentioned it, and I thought at the time, "That&#8217;s silly. What man looks at that? My goodness!" But I never thought more than that about it. So then the connection is made between Playboy and the rapes, and it turns out that my daughter wasn&#8217;t the only one. It was the neighbor children, boys and girls. This kid was molesting them, and he was getting therapy, so the therapist wasn&#8217;t permitted to tell any of the neighbors or anybody, warn anybody that we had a predator in our midst, because there&#8217;s [doctor-patient] privilege. What is going on here? EF: And this is while you were in Cleveland? JR: [Pause] I don&#8217;t remember. No. I don&#8217;t remember. I can&#8217;t figure it out. EF: That&#8217;s okay. JR: Yeah, so I have that background. My daughter doesn&#8217;t want me to talk to anybody but I get permission to tell my friend, Carol. I call my friend Carol and I tell her. She&#8217;s in Berkeley. She&#8217;s as Berkeley as you can get. I tell her, &#8220;Carol, this is what happened to Jenny and I&#8217;m so upset,&#8221; and she says, &#8220;Judy, you don&#8217;t understand. Children are sexual from birth. She probably kind of wanted this experience,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;No, she didn&#8217;t. Thank you very much,&#8221; and I hung up. Then I called my aunt in Maryland, matriarch kind of lady, couldn&#8217;t be more different, and I tell her what happened and she says, &#8220;Well, Judy, you have to understand, children are sexual from birth. She was probably a little interested,&#8221; and so on. Now, I have been a communist-type and I know a party line when I hear a party line, and how you have a party line bridging thosekinds of areas, geographically and experientially and politically, there&#8217;s still agreement, the same? She writes about it now, Linda Bartlett. EF: Right. JR: It&#8217;s wonderful. EF: So, if I can ask, how did your daughter deal with that terrible experience and how did you, as a parent and as a researcher, also put it all together? JR: Well for a year, she didn&#8217;t deal with it well because we didn&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t know. Once she said what happened, and in those years we didn&#8217;t know to call it rape, so I said, &#8220;Well you were seduced. You were seduced.&#8221; She said he had her shoes and she couldn&#8217;t go. It didn&#8217;t matter to her, I suppose. It&#8217;s okay, the words. I said, &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t your fault,&#8221; and so on. EF: Sure. JR: And I couldn&#8217;t do anything about him because the woman had sent him back to England. They apparently knew. They heard from the other kids so they got rid of the kid. So then, it took a little while, but she was okay after she told me and we told her father &#8211; I got permission &#8211; and he handled it okay: &#8220;It&#8217;s not your fault,&#8221; and so on. But I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if the brain aneurysm that she had, that she died from really, had something to do with that.References 5-6 - 5.73% CoverageYes. [Hugh] Hefner said he was reading Kinsey, he was a virgin in college and he was reading Kinsey, and he would be Kinsey&#8217;s pamphleteer. Yeah? Then I was delivering my paper on women and their reactions to pornography and so on at the British Psychological Association [conference on love and attraction], and Tom O&#8217;Carroll, a pedophile, who headed the Pedophile Information Exchange in England where they had a list of how you get kids, where you find them and all, was coming to our conference. I knew that a group of people at the conference were pedophiles, or just deviants and perverts, because they were on the Penthouse &#8220;Forum.&#8221; So it&#8217;s complicated. All the academicians there at this conference, except me, said that Tom O&#8217;Carroll, freedom of speech, he should come and he should speak about pedophilia as a viable exchange, and I said, &#8220;Heck no. [We were in Wales.] We&#8217;re guests of the people and we have no right to bring in a pedophile who advocates raping their kids, and then we leave and they&#8217;re left with that talk from an academic institution? No. Never.&#8221; So I was the only one who said that. Everybody else thought it was a freedom of speech, right, which says a lot about our academic sensibility, in my opinion. Anyway, so I was presenting my paper and a psychologist that was there came up to me and said, &#8220;If you really are concerned about child sexual abuse,&#8221; because that was in the Playboy, he says, &#8220;You have to look at Kinsey,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; I mean, I knew Kinsey, so I said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; So he said, &#8220;I worked with Kinsey and with Wardell Pomeroy. One is a pedophile and the other is a homosexual.&#8221; So I said, &#8220;Which is which?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Read and discover,&#8221; and he walked out of the room and walked out of my life. I can&#8217;t find him. So, I did. I read and I discovered. So that&#8217;s how the connection came between &#8211; and Kinsey was the man who said, &#8220;Children are sexual from birth.&#8221; Nobody had said that before him, and Playboy drew it in their cartoon. So the picture echoed the position of Kinsey, and that&#8217;s been disastrous for children. It&#8217;s been disastrous. Children are spiritual from birth. There&#8217;s nothing biblical that says that they&#8217;re sexual. There&#8217;s nothing that defines children as sexual at all, and skipping past biblically, if we&#8217;re talking anatomically and biologically, no. That&#8217;s not true. The churches have accepted it, a lot of them: we have to have sex education because children are sexual. What? There isn&#8217;t the slightest reason to believe that. They&#8217;re sexualized. They&#8217;re hyper-sexualized by our society, by the mass media, but left to their own lives, living, that&#8217;s not true at all, not at all. So that&#8217;s how I got involved. References 7-9 - 14.90% CoverageJR: Yeah. [Brief interruption] Well, first thing I did is I read. I read what he wrote, what he said, and it&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s in his two books. Chapter five shows a two-month-old baby being masturbated, or digitally manipulated &#8211; or maybe penetrated, because later on one of his colleagues said that they did involve penetration &#8211; for a certain amount of time in order to get an orgasm. Then he has a three-month-old, four-month-old, five-month-old, six-month-old, and he lists these little children, and that&#8217;s torture. That&#8217;s what they were doing to the little babies. Tables 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and what he called&#8211;. Then I looked. I said, okay. Alright. Okay, so these are what he said, that they did over &#8211; and the timing, how long it took to get the orgasm, and the time in between orgasms of the kids, and I said okay; what did he call an orgasm? I thought sure the guy would have not described it, but he did. Page 160 and 161. He said that there were one hundred and ninety-six children and he broke them up into six categories, six types &#8211; that&#8217;s what he called it, six types &#8211; one, two, three, four, five, six. That made it very scientific. It&#8217;s got numbers and everything, you see? Then he said that the children screamed, they cried, hysterical tears, and he put in parentheses, &#8220;Especially among the younger children.&#8221; What? What? Then he said, &#8220;And some strike the partner.&#8221; That&#8217;s the man who was raping them. Excuse me. &#8220;Strike the partner and try and get away.&#8221; Yeah? &#8220;But,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they definitely enjoy the experience because they often return to&#8211;,&#8221; and I thought, "Holy smokes! This is got to be a sadomasochistic&#8211;." Do you want to see the charts and all that? EF: Perhaps after the interview. JR: I said, "He has got to be a sadomasochistic pedophile." I mean, that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s got to be. There&#8217;s no human being who could describe babies writhing in pain and say that they enjoyed that as an orgasm but a sadomasochistic pedophile, so that means he was a pedophile. And this is the most quoted science in the world on sex? This is the science that we base sex education on, and this is the science that churches say children are sexual from birth based on? EF: So you produced some of your findings, and how was it received in the academic community over the 1970s and 1980s? JR: Well first, before I did that, I was supposed to research Kinsey and Playboy. The Department of Justice&#8211;. EF: Right. JR: Yeah. I was principal investigator. EF: At American University, or it was funded through there? JR: Yeah, American University. EF: This was in 1984, somewhere in that&#8211;? JR: Yeah. The trouble was the president was a pedophile. The trouble was&#8211;. EF: The president of American University? JR: Of American University, yeah, was a pedophile. The trouble was the head of the psych department was apparently a pedophile too. He was supposed to have [had] sex with a little nine-year-old girl in his trailer park at a nudist colony, Elliott McGinnies, so I had a lot of trouble at the university getting my research approved and so on. I don&#8217;t know how many others because birds of a feather flock together. You try to make sure that nobody&#8217;s going to squeal on you, that you have around you the right people, because otherwise somebody may tell. Somebody may report you or something. So I was supposed to do the research on Kinsey at American University. The Department of Justice &#8211; this was under Reagan, the last great chance anybody ever had to do any research &#8211; so then my grant hit all kinds of trouble. Well, I did know, but it turns out Playboy, Penthouse, Hustler, they were all lobbying American University. They were going crazy because they thought I would find what I found. So they were threatening them, and the Kinsey Institute was threatening them, and I was sitting there in my office, trying to do my study. So then the Kinsey Institute threatened to sue them if American University let me do what I was going to do, so they cut out academic freedom, thank you very much. So they cut out any ability of me to research Kinsey&#8217;s work, which was ridiculous because I wasn&#8217;t experimenting. He was, but I wasn&#8217;t. I was going to look at the documents and try and find out where the children came from, because we had a lot of leads at that time. He&#8217;d gone into the orphanages and into the homes of the colored children &#8211; in those years &#8211; and so we were checking those out, but they cut our throats. They said, &#8220;No way. You&#8217;re not going to do that research.&#8221; EF: So American didn&#8217;t allow it? JR: Mm hmm. EF: They didn&#8217;t publish it? JR: No. They didn&#8217;t allow me to do the research. EF: Oh, I see. JR: The academic committee of respectable academics was the one that said, &#8220;No, you can&#8217;t do that. You can&#8217;t.&#8221; So, okay, but they let me do the Playboy stuff. EF: Okay. JR: You can look at Playboy. So I figured well; if that&#8217;s all we can do that&#8217;s all we can do. So we did the research on Playboy and found that they had been sexualizing children from 1954 and had engaged in what is now known as child pornography regularly. That seems important. The public needs to know that. Grandpa and Father weren&#8217;t looking at innocuous stuff. He thought he was looking at innocuous things but they weren&#8217;t innocuous because the way they work on the brain leaves no doubt that they work on the brain. They&#8217;re what we call &#8220;flashbulb memories,&#8221; that is everyone remembers that first nude that they saw, everyone, and they remember, in those days, because it&#8217;s not like now on the iPads and everything else, and they remember where they were and who they were with when they saw that sexy image. They remember everything and they remember the cartoons. They remember all the cartoons. How do I know that? Because of a lot of research I&#8217;ve done since, but the fellow who told me about Kinsey, who said go look at Kinsey? When I saw him earlier I said, &#8220;There are kids in Playboy,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;No, there aren&#8217;t,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Yeah, there are,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;No, there aren&#8217;t.&#8221; He&#8217;s a psychologist and he knows. [I said,] &#8220;So you know Playboy?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Well, yeah, I&#8217;ve seen it, and there aren&#8217;t.&#8221; EF: How were you defining&#8211;? What constituted &#8220;children?&#8221; JR: Under eighteen. EF: Okay. JR: Under eighteen. EF: Did you do research to find out who&#8211;? Like some of them were cartoons, but for those that were photos did you look into who they were? JR: Yep. There&#8217;s a clear picture of Jodie Foster when she was fourteen, graphic, and Brooke Shields, graphic. Okay? Alright. And others. Mostly what Playboy did is they used out-cuts from [what they called] &#8220;Sex and Cinema.&#8221; They used out-cuts from foreign films or they used Hamilton&#8217;s ethereal images of coming-of-age, but they would have really rough&#8211;. Nowadays we call child pornography adults who are dressed to look like children, or peope who look like children who are designed with the hair bows and all that stuff, because now they realize it&#8217;s taken this amount of time, but they realize that that is just as precipitating as the real child. So, they had a lot of that, women dressed as children, looking like childrenReferences 10-11 - 4.41% CoverageJR: Sure. It&#8217;s child abuse. There&#8217;s no transfer. There&#8217;s no transfer. The high rate of child abuse amongst what are called &#8220;gay and lesbian,&#8221; and what are called &#8220;transgender,&#8221; and what are called &#8220;queer,&#8221; and what are called all those other kinds of names is off the charts, except nobody wants to address that. I did my research using The Advocate. Do you know what The Advocate is? EF: I&#8217;ve heard of it. JR: It&#8217;s the mainstream. It&#8217;s the oldest and the mainstream homosexual magazine. EF: Okay. JR: You can&#8217;t get anything that&#8217;s more mainstream than The Advocate. I did research along with a statistician on The Advocate and they &#8211; admissions on their part &#8211; twenty-one percent of their readers, who are the basically white, upscale, urban, basically these are the guys, are sexually abused before age fifteen by adults. Now, they left out sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen. The sixteen and seventeen, those years, would be your biggest abuse populations. They didn&#8217;t count those and they didn&#8217;t count older kids as abusers. Okay? Alright. Even still, twenty-one percent are talking about they were sexually abused. What are you doing? You&#8217;re turning your back on twenty-one percent? Now, what they&#8217;ve done &#8211; and the same thing with lesbians. There was a Dutch [study], I think it was, and fifty-some percent of the kids were abused. What they do is the abused kids are mislabeled gay. What you do is you have an abused kid and instead of finding out who&#8217;s abused them and putting him in jail &#8211; you don&#8217;t see many abusers of gay kids put in jail unless they&#8217;re priests. Instead of getting the people who have violated them, the perpetrators, they say, "Oh, well, they&#8217;re gay. They&#8217;re gay." So that means they&#8217;re going to die earlier, they&#8217;re going to have all kinds of venereal diseases and everything else that they don&#8217;t need to have. Instead of protecting those children, instead of protecting those people, we&#8217;re labeling those people, labeling them. It may be politically acceptable today but it&#8217;s not going to help them. So, that&#8217;s my position.References 12-13 - 6.21% CoverageJR: Yeah, actually he did. EF: &#8211;in DC? JR: Yeah, yeah. He went all over. In Los Angeles they were about to tighten the laws on predators. He went to Los Angeles and he lied. He testified that children are not harmed by sexual abuse, that he had investigated thousands of children and [no, there&#8217;s no harm,] and so on and so on. As a matter of fact Kinsey acolytes, John Money and Fred Berlin, and another guy, Peterson, they advised the Catholic Church that pedophiles could be cured and could go back. So, that little tidbit was interesting. But the main thing was the laws on rape&#8211;. Estrich &#8211; that&#8217;s her name? I&#8217;ve forgotten her first name. She wrote an article in the Yale Law Review on rape, and she was Dukakis&#8217;s lawyer or something. She&#8217;s very popular and she wrote an article in the Yale Law Review on rape and she said, &#8220;What has happened to the rape laws?&#8221; She said, &#8220;With the conservatives we had tougher penalties for rape than we have with the liberals,&#8221; and she&#8217;s very liberal. She said the America Law Institute Model Penal Code&#8211;. Do you know anything about that? EF: Not really. JR: It&#8217;s the code that&#8217;s gone all over the country. The Model Penal Code supplanted&#8211;. You had the Common Law and you have now a belief in science, okay, which supplanted the Common Law. Science supplanted the Common Law. Well, what science? What science? Science on rape. What science on rape? What science on child abuse? What science on divorce? What science on sodomy? The Model Penal Code from 1955, and who do they cite in the Model Penal Code a hundred percent on sodomy and on rape? The Kinsey Institute, Alfred Kinsey. So, in 1948 half the states in the union had a penalty of death for rape &#8211; did you know that? &#8211; simple rape, not cutting off the arms, not a little kid, just a regular male-female kind of rape, the old fashioned kind. You know that&#8217;s changed. The kind of rape we deal with now has changed. It&#8217;s radically changed. But anyway, so, rape. Half the states offered the death penalty, the other half, life. You could get life for rape, and one of them you could get forty years. Okay. What does that tell you about the attitude, the relationship between women and men at that time? You believe the woman who said she was raped because virginity was a prized property of hers. She wouldn&#8217;t say she was raped and risk the fact that she was no longer a virgin. Kinsey came along and said: these women are all lying. They&#8217;re really promiscuous. They &#8211; fornication was against the law &#8211; they have engaged in fornication. But there&#8217;s no downside to anything. There was never a downside. He didn&#8217;t have a downside. He didn&#8217;t have abortion. He didn&#8217;t have venereal disease. He didn&#8217;t have child sexual abuse that wasn&#8217;t considered child sexual abuse. There was no downside to anything that he said we participated in. We were all promiscuous and it&#8217;s just that Grandpa and Grandma were hiding it. They were liars. Get it? So, that led me into an investigation of the laws.References 14-16 - 2.53% CoverageJR: Women are reacting to their loss. They don&#8217;t know often that they&#8217;re reacting to their loss but they are. EF: Just to clarify, loss of what? JR: Of their womanhood, of their honor, of their integrity that they did have. There were problems pre-feminism. There were, you know. There were problems in the workplace, or there were problems in fair employment, other things that are not right, but now they&#8217;ve lost who they are as women. They&#8217;re treated like slabs of meat. This hook-up business: all part of the idea of feminism. [Sighs] And the rate of divorce, the rate of abortion, of venereal disease, all these things, they are examples of women who have come to believe frauds and who have given up their womanhood. They&#8217;ve given up their womanhood. We have a lot of women who are molesting children, women teachers molesting children. Something radical has happened to the character of our people, and this radical thing that has happened has happened to women. In my life &#8211; and it&#8217;s not imagination &#8211; women didn&#8217;t do those things. Somebody might, some weird gal might, but women, molesting children? When women start molesting children the last barrier of protection for them is gone. So, we&#8217;re in a very dangerous place.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Renz_Constance_Anne> - § 5 references coded  [14.94% Coverage]Reference 1 - 2.11% CoverageI don&#8217;t know exactly why. It&#8217;s not that I came from a family of where my father hit my mother. That didn&#8217;t, that never happened as far as I know. I had a sister who bullied me. I&#8217;m certainly aware about that, but I don&#8217;t know why that, that became such an important issue to me, but it did. And I think partly, I did see, for example, women in my child protective services caseload who were being battered, so, and I was very aware of the position that they were in, that they were being held accountable for the man&#8217;s violence. And they were losing a lot. They were losing not only their safety, but their children, because they supposedly couldn&#8217;t control this man&#8217;s violence. And, and that&#8217;s a terrible injustice. And, so I guess I was aware of that on a professional level, too. And of course that movement was beginning to grow, and it was one of the, you know, first movements coming out of the Women&#8217;s Movement. There was rape crisis of course, but I was not as involved with that, and then there was domestic violence. Reference 2 - 0.74% CoverageAnd then, I had my second child during that time, too, so then I left there after two years, and worked on the Duke Child Protection Team, and that was doing sex abuse evaluation for young children. And I did that for three years. And that was also part time, thirty hours. And that worked well with, with my family and my interests in child protection and in women&#8217;s issues.References 3-4 - 8.56% Coverage CR: Mm-kay. I think, probably--you know I certainly was very aware of stigma with battered women. The tremendous blame that they received just because they were battered women. Well, the stigma and the discrimination against women who use substances is, is terrible. As bad, or worse, where there is this great condemnation of her, and how she&#8217;s hurting her child, how she&#8217;s deserving of the bad things that happen to her because she shouldn&#8217;t be drinking. I mean, and there&#8217;s a long history, of course, showing, you know--when you see a woman drinking on the street, and, you know not in control of herself--of saying, you know, &#8216;She deserves what she gets,&#8217; or &#8216;She must be a prostitute,&#8217; or whatever it is. And then, of course when it involves an infant or a fetus, there&#8217;s this even greater condemnation, because motherhood is to be this sacred thing that only the worst women would, you know, not do as they should. So, I think that is the stigma that is really, really one we continue to fight again, and again, and again. So, part of our role was, has been, to outreach to all the people who might provide to her, and talk with them about what addiction is about what addiction is about for women. I mean, how they get involved in it, what keeps them in it, what are the things that prevent them from recovering, so that they have a much more empathetic understanding of what this is about. So that they&#8217;re not, they&#8217;re more willing to, give her a hand like they would someone else with a major problem, and--as opposed to judging her. And I can give you an example. We used to go to nurseries up in the hospitals, unnamed hospitals, and ask, you know, nurses, let&#8217;s say in the NICUs that--you know how did they feel about our patients, and women who had used and their babies were now in the NICU. Even if the mom&#8217;s use had nothing to do with why the baby was in the NICU. Well, I mean, they could say, you know, very clearly how angry they were at these women, and that it would translate into behaviors, like not welcoming her home when she came in. You know, like another woman, she might say, &#8216;Oh, Mary, come over and see what Frankie&#8217;s doing today. And I want to show you this.&#8217; They wouldn&#8217;t necessarily do that, because they would assume she didn&#8217;t care, she shouldn&#8217;t have done what she did. It was a very punitive response, which we all understand because we all have some of those feelings, but when we&#8217;re professionals, you need to be aware of those feelings, and then make sure that you&#8217;re doing what your role is, which is to help this woman take a different road. Or they wouldn&#8217;t give her information, or necessarily share things with her that they would with a woman who was not using and a mother of her infant in the NICU. So, we know that people really need to look at some of their attitudes. And, and when you ask anyone, &#8216;How do you feel about let&#8217;s say a eight-month-old pregnant woman, you know, smoking? You know, how do you feel?&#8217; We want people to talk about how they feel and what are their--what are they thinking when they see that. And, and, they become more aware of, &#8216;Wow, they say she&#8217;s stupid, where she&#8217;s been, how ignorant can you be?&#8217; Or, you know, &#8216;I can&#8217;t have a baby and here she gets to have a baby, and she can&#8217;t even, you know, take care of this baby.&#8217; That, that those are normal things that, in our culture, brought up in our culture, that we&#8217;re going to feel and think. But then we have to go beyond that if we&#8217;re going to be helpers for someone who&#8217;s making some changes in this area, to how we can be helpful to her, and to understand what&#8217;s going on with her that that&#8217;s what she&#8217;s doing. Now of course, as it turns out, and this is how the circle goes around, one of the primary issues for women in substance addictions is trauma. You know, they have been child sexual abuse survivors, rape victims, battering victims, and that&#8217;s a major way that women cope with trauma, and learn how to manage, PTSD symptoms is to, to zone out, you know, to numb out. And that&#8217;s a major piece of what&#8217;s going on for many of the women that we work with. So, I mean it was like really, for me, a circle coming around.Reference 5 - 3.53% CoverageCR: Well, why they create them is of course, one - a lot of it&#8217;s learned behavior. If they see their parents or people in their community deal with life and life&#8217;s problems by drinking, then, you know, like other behaviors, you know, that&#8217;s what they may decide to do, too. And, in fact, see it as normal, fine, okay, as long as you don&#8217;t do certain things. And then, though, if they become hooked, then really addicted to it, then they&#8217;ve got major problems. So it may be the learned behavior. And we can see that everywhere. When someone dies, someone says, &#8216;Oh, give her a Valium, you know, so she can sleep tonight.&#8217; Or, &#8216;she needs a stiff drink,&#8217; so she can manage those feelings. I mean, it&#8217;s a very common thing for us to do is to take a pill or a drug or alcohol as a way of dealing with an emotion that&#8217;s uncomfortable or painful. And, so there&#8217;s that culturally going on, and then if it&#8217;s happening in your homes, behaviorally, you see it and you have access to it, then you&#8217;re likely to use that as a way. Now, and you&#8217;ll see this with our women who have been sexually abused as children, when you ask them at what age they started taking alcohol or a drug, and you know, six, eight, ten. You know, what&#8217;s going on that a child would be doing that at that age? What&#8217;s happening in that family that they have, one, access to it, but that that is seen as something&#8217;s going on that they need that. So, a large part of it is that it&#8217;s how our society tends to cope with things, is through taking pills. And you know pills, now, is the major addiction we&#8217;re dealing with. Opiate addiction, now, is number one here. And it&#8217;s pills prescribed by doctors, you know, for pain, or for anxiety.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Robinson_Gail> - § 2 references coded  [0.75% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.75% Coverage I will never forget, Bill Waters, his wife&#8217;s name was Cathy, she had been a rape victim.

The uncle ended up being in prison in a mental institution until he died, and even before my mother told me the story we got this notice saying Uncle Eli has died, and all the kids said, &#8220;Who is Uncle Eli? How come we&#8217;ve never heard of Uncle Eli? We know Uncle Jim, we know Uncle Eskie, we know Booker T.; how come we don&#8217;t know about Uncle Eli? How did we miss this uncle?&#8221; My mother said, &#8220;Oh, he was one of Big Mama&#8217;s children,&#8221; and that&#8217;s all she said about Uncle Eli, and nobody went to his funeral or anything. So Uncle Eli was like the big mystery but we weren&#8217;t curious enough to try to follow it up. Well it turns out Uncle Eli was the uncle that sexually abused all the girls in the family. So Mama never had a healthy relationship around sex and sexuality, and then when I became pregnant through incest, through a cousin, my mother went ballistic. She actually beat me for being pregnant. She was not healthy around sex and sexuality. I could never under&#8212;. And she did some really predictable but what seemed to be bizarre things at the time, like every time my father would take one of his daughters out&#8212;and me and my father were particularly close so I hung out with Daddy all the time. I was Daddy&#8217;s girl. Daddy was the light of my life and I loved him to death. I know I was his favorite child and he knows he was my favorite parent, so there was no ambiguity at all about our relationship, but my mother would get so angry. I knew the minute I came home whatever I did it was not going to be right, and they believed in corporal punishment, so if I didn&#8217;t wash the dishes good enough that night I was going to get a whipping. It wasn&#8217;t until years later that I put together her fear around an adult male having a child outside of her eyes. My big sister told me, &#8220;She did the same with me.&#8221; She was just paranoid and it wasn&#8217;t until she told us her story, after we were already in our thirties [Laughs] that we were able to put all the pieces together, because what seemed to be craziness was actually PTSD. CGD: Were you able to tell your mother about the incest? LR: I had to. CGD: Was she able to hear it and process it? LR: [Pause] I&#8217;m not sure, because she got terribly re-stimulated by it. She had blamed herself for her own so she blamed me for mine. We actually agreed that I would go to a home for unwed mothers. CGD: How old were you? LR: Fourteen. CGD: Okay. So, I&#8217;m thinking about Rickie Solinger&#8217;s book about unwed mothers, of course later time period, and the argument is that basically in the &#8217;50s there are very few homes for black unwed mothers, so what was your experience? LR: It wasn&#8217;t a black home but I was the only black girl at the home. It was a home run by the Salvation Army in San Antonio, near Trinity University, over on the other side of town. The Salvation Army ran a number of these homes across America. A little bit more skirt to the story, I had already received a scholarship to Radcliffe and, trust me, having Melvin baby, was not how I planned on becoming a mama. I was not planning on being a mama. He was supposed to be babysitting me and he thought it was a better idea to have sex with me, and he was a serial abuser. That was one of the things that I really challenged within my family, how multigenerational the incest was, and yet we couldn&#8217;t talk about sex and sexuality, and I challenged that. The minute I became conscious of it I started introducing this very awkward conversation into our family. [Laughs] Whenever I see a young budding niece I go have a conversation with their mama, with my brother, whoever it was needed to have a conversation, and they would dread me coming, because I would say, &#8220;You know what happened to me, you know what happened to Mama; we got to stop this in this generation here, okay? I don&#8217;t even know how far back it goes but I know it&#8217;s going to stop in this generation, and I will kill any of you that lay a hand on anybody and I find out about it.&#8221; References 3-4 - 0.26% Coverage I see my daddy in my son all the time, because he didn&#8217;t grow up with a father, obviously, because of the incest. He didn&#8217;t have the opportunity. He got to meet his father when he turned twenty-one because I finally told him the story, but it was my father who made him a man and he spent a lot of time with my parents.References 5-6 - 0.62% CoverageWhat can I say? So I was already deeply questioning the church, and then when I got pregnant and had to stand up and publicly profess that I was a sinner though I&#8217;d been incested, I was through with that deal then. CGD: And did you go back after that? LR: I have not been to a church for service since then. I&#8217;ve been there for weddings, I&#8217;ve given speeches from the pulpit, I&#8217;ve been there for lots of funerals, but I&#8217;ve not been there as a worshiper since I was fifteen years old with a baby and I was accused of being the sinner when a twenty-seven-year-old had incested me. Oh, no, no, no, no. This deal I don&#8217;t like. And then you tell me my baby&#8217;s born in sin. My baby is a baby. [Laughs] He ain&#8217;t done nothing. So the whole deal did not make sense to me.References 7-8 - 2.63% Coverage I was lucky to be in Washington, D.C. that had a growing feminist movement. The D.C. Area Feminist Alliance was getting off the ground. The D.C. Rape Crisis Center was the first rape crisis center in the country and it was founded in 1972. So there was a feminist bubbling in the atmosphere in Washington, D.C. in those times so it wasn&#8217;t&#8212;I mean we didn&#8217;t have Google to do our searches for us [Laughs] but if you paid attention and were conscious you could find stuff. CGD: And was that D.C. feminist movement&#8212;? Did it reflect the racial diversity of D.C.? LR: No, because D.C. at the time was eighty percent black and there were those of us who&#8217;d go to the DCAFA meetings&#8212;like I said, the D.C. Area Feminist Alliance, we called it DCAFA&#8212;but we were never more than one, two, or three voices at a meeting out of say fifteen, twenty people. But at the same time I really admired the working class consciousness that the white women had. I mean the way we all got jobs at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center was that it was a group of six white women that founded it, out of a hotline basically, but they made a commitment that whenever they got their first grants to pay salaries they were going to hire women from the community, which meant black women, and even though they were working class white women themselves who needed jobs&#8212;. I mean they were not wealthy women. One was a carpenter, one was a telephone operator. They could have easily done what most cities did and reserved the jobs for themselves but they made a political and philosophical commitment to hire black women with their first grants, so Michelle Hudson became the first executive director of the Rape Crisis Center, then [Akinje 1:05:46] became the second, and I became the third. So the D.C. Rape Crisis Center just became a hotbed of black feminism because of that, so I&#8217;ve always felt that books should be written about those six white women, because they did something that no other group of white women in any other part of America did, which was grandmother and foment the leadership of black feminism as an intentional project. We were so lucky to be in Washington, absolute lucky. CGD: So it was Rosa Carpenter, and who else were some of the other women? LR: Rosa Carpenter? CGD: I thought you just said Rosa Carpenter. LR: No, I said one was a carpenter. CGD: Oh, okay. LR: She was a carpenter. Deborah Freeman was a carpenter. CGD: Oh, okay. Are some of those women still alive? LR: Mary Alice [1:06:36]. I don&#8217;t know if they are or not. I&#8217;m sure Deb Freeman is because I think I saw something from her on Facebook. [1:06:45 Akinje] would know because she stays in more frequent contact because she&#8217;s still in D.C. and I&#8217;m not, so she would know. She stayed at the Rape Crisis Center for fourteen years&#8212;I stayed for three&#8212;because even after she stepped down as ED she stayed on as program director under me and then under two more executive directors, so she would know more about it than I. CGD: So did working with the D.C. Rape Crisis Center help move you to later, like your work with NOW? LR: Yeah. Well that was my first formal job in the women&#8217;s movement. I mean I&#8217;d had one other social justice job before then and that was working for the NFL Players Association, their union, so that was my very first social justice job.References 9-10 - 1.15% CoverageYou know, I keep it&#8212;. Well even before I started talking about abortion and incest I was talking about sterilization abuse, which is acceptable, but I started talking about rape, which was not, in the black community. CGD: Why do you think that was not acceptable? LR: Because ninety-five percent of rapes are intra-racial. If I wanted to talk about rape as something white men did to black women I could have had the Ida B. Wells story, but talking about rape as something that black men do to black women, it&#8217;s airing dirty laundry. So long before I started publicly talking about abortion I was committing the social faux pas of talking about rape and incest in the black community as something black people did to ourselves. I mean I&#8217;ve gotten booed off black stages and stuff, I mean stages at black conferences and conventions. They always used to accuse us of selling out to the white women, and one guy called me&#8212;he and his wife, [1:41:36], I&#8217;ll never forget them&#8212;they accused me of being a representative of COINTELPRO because I was talking about this stuff and it wasn&#8217;t helping the black community, and so I had to be a plant by the FBI to destabilize the black movement. [Sighs; laughs] That was a pretty heavy charge, to accuse somebody of being COINTELPRO back in that day, because that set you up for somebody just taking you out of here, only because I was talking about gender oppression and they didn&#8217;t want to talk about it.References 11-12 - 0.48% CoverageBut your larger question, because I worked first in the anti-rape movement and then the anti-sterilization abuse movement, then the prochoice movement, and now in the women&#8217;s human rights movement, I&#8217;ve always had to deal with what I call the impact of white supremacy on the feminist movement because the feminist movement likes to think that because they work against gender oppression that they work against racial oppression automatically, and that&#8217;s not a given. They are intensely uncomfortable, for the most part, with how black women claim and redefine feminism for ourselves, and we intersect it. Reference 13 - 0.38% CoverageNo, no. I don&#8217;t think we were an unusual generation. I think we just fell into the chain of leadership that our ancestors set out for us. I was lucky enough in my twenties to be appointed to the D.C. Commission for Women by Marion Barry when I was at the Rape Crisis Center, and there were blue-haired black women who knew Mary Church Terrell and Mary McLeod Bethune who took me under their wings and showed me a lot about women&#8217;s power and feminist consciousness through a black lens. <Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Rostan_June> - § 2 references coded  [1.75% Coverage]References 1-2 - 1.75% Coverage In terms of the women&#8217;s movement in Appalachia, I think it&#8217;s the determination or designation of identity as workers in a particular industry that differentiated that group from other women&#8217;s groups. Other women&#8217;s groups, I guess, were based in the community or were groups of women who were fighting for particular women&#8217;s issues like-- [Pause] Like reproductive rights or freedom from sexual assault and domestic violence or more broad women&#8217;s organizations. Like there were local chapters of the National Organization of Women during that time, and then there were a few groups that were regionally identified like the Coalition of Appalachian Women, and things like that. So it was that focus on work, working as a coal miner, a female coal miner that set itself, set it apart. <Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Rovetti_Corinne_McNabb_Richard_McNabb_Bernadette> - § 6 references coded  [1.42% Coverage]References 1-2 - 0.82% CoverageBecause it was always available.

This Italian immigrant woman comes to the US and she&#8217;s raped, and she gets pregnant and she&#8217;s in Chicago at this point. So Pamela has done all this research on abortion in the 1900s, and she came to me because we were looking for what kind of instruments would they have had and used and how would the abortion have been performed.

So the more pitiful you could present yourself as a nonprofit, the more likely you&#8217;d be to get money. <Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Short_Joan_Boyd> - § 2 references coded  [2.89% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.89% CoverageThis was 1968 that I went canoeing on a river with some friends, and other people left and I was waiting on a couple of people to come back with a canoe, and we didn&#8217;t really know where we were. But I met a family there and the man was being abusive to his three-year-old daughter, and I am sure it was clear on my face that I didn&#8217;t approve. She had hit him, and he had hit her, and then she had hit him. But he was hitting her until she had red splotches all over, and he had been drinking, and I could tell the mother was really upset. We were in a very remote picnic area. It was getting dark and the man offered to go up and let me look down and see if I could see my compatriots, and if I didn&#8217;t I was going to go back into - I was up near Cookville, Tennessee. Anyway, without the gory details, he ended up beating me up and raping me, and I was twenty one at the time. But the thing that has ended up about that experience is that I had never had a violent experience before, never been in a violent situation. My parents were very gentle people. Most of the people I knew were gentle people, so I had never come up against violence in that way. But what he kept saying-and he was almost in a trance-what he kept saying over and over again is that &#8220;I have killed women and children in Vietnam and I can crack your neck with one hand.&#8221; He just kept saying that over and over about Vietnam. He was a Vietnam vet. Later I commented to someone, they said, &#8220;Who raped you?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;The war.&#8221; Because I really came to see it that way. I didn&#8217;t prosecute because of my father&#8217;s health. I actually ended up knowing who he was because his wife had given me his business card, because she liked my dog, and she had no idea. I think she must have sensed that something happened, because I took him back and I was all beaten up, and I just let him out of the car and drove off. He had no idea that I had his business card in my pocket. I just could not do that to my parents. They would have never gotten a night&#8217;s rest about me. It was hard enough for them for me to be on my own. But that is what has haunted me about that period of time. So I am very sensitive about violence towards women, sexual violence, but I am also sensitive about what wars do to people. I think if women made those decisions, as they do in some Native American cultures-in the Cherokee culture, it is the women who tell the men whether to go to war or not-I don&#8217;t think women would kill each other&#8217;s children quite so hastily. I just think that it is a sad situation that our world, and that our particular society in America, does not have as part of the tightest threads of its fabric the wisdom of women. That they don&#8217;t take it seriously.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Sobieski_Wanda_2> - § 3 references coded  [2.15% Coverage]Reference 1 - 1.04% CoverageI was probably ahead of the professors on some of that by the time I got into graduate school. Now as an undergraduate I did have a professor who sexually harassed all the women, wouldn&#8217;t keep his hands off of us, how you responded clearly affected your grade. It was really a bad situation but there was no Title VII, there was no Title IX, there was no sexual harassment law, there was nothing. There was literally nothing that could be done so I decided that maybe just embarrassing him or getting somebody superior to him to talk to him, maybe that would take care of it. So I went to see the department head who sent me on to see a dean and their response to me was, well that&#8217;s what you get if you&#8217;re going to be out in the world. So in certain ways I had fairly advanced ideas and understandings but when it came to that intimate home setting it was much more complex to try to figure out how to make that all work. References 2-3 - 1.11% Coverage Domestic violence was still then a very private matter, sure, yeah. I think that really helped put us in the public arena to get people thinking and talking, and people who might not actually want to be seen with us identifying with us privately and quietly, and that can reflect itself in the ballot box or sometimes in a checkbook. I think those issues did help, people could identify with those. We&#8217;ve made a lot of progress in terms of raising public awareness on those issues and made some law changes but the underlying problem still exists and I see it all the time in my practice. I practice a lot of domestic law and violence and people quietly hiding their secret of violence in their home goes on every day still. It&#8217;s very difficult to root that out, and that may be fundamentally a disrespect issue and you disrespect the people who aren&#8217;t equal. If they&#8217;re not as good as you and they&#8217;re not entitled to the same opportunity then they&#8217;re somehow a subspecies.<Files\\UNCTWMS\\UNCTWMS_Stokes_Jeanette> - § 2 references coded  [5.42% Coverage]References 1-2 - 5.42% Coverage JS: No, I had been involved with rape crisis a little bit when I was in Durham.

There were a lot of women there, and then we fought for a women&#8217;s studies department, and there was also a women&#8217;s services. And this was the great struggle between academic feminists versus women who really did the work out in the community and on the ground. They often could not talk to each other. It was rough. I, at one point at Northeastern, was the chair of both of those boards. And I was fit and determined to get everybody to work together. LL: Can you say a little bit more about the divide? The other department was called women&#8217;s services? PW: Mm-hmm. LL: So which faction did that represent? PW: That was the rape crisis center counseling andthe returning women and things that were really service providers, and they of course thought the academics had their head in the ivory tower, which they did a lot. As an academic, a lapsed academic, I can criticize, and I've seen that over the years in my political work here, these academics who teach public policy and sociology and politics, they have no idea what really goes on, and they don&#8217;t talk to the people who are actually working. LL: So was this department&#8212;the women&#8217;s services department&#8212;I mean was that, could you get a degree in that? PW: No, no, no. LL: Or it was just like a center? PW: That was on the student services side. LL: Right. Okay. I see. So they were working the rape crisis center. They were sort of doing the direct services, so to speak. PW: So there was this struggle between academic feminists and service providers. There was also a huge struggle between lesbian women and straight women. I identified myself for years as a political lesbian. For years I didn&#8217;t wear my wedding band because it gave me heterosexual privilege. And I&#8217;ll never forget this women philosophy professor. She was very radical, and she once said to me, &#8220;I can&#8217;t trust you&#8221;&#8212;this was in a big group of women, straight and gay&#8212;&#8220;I can&#8217;t trust you because ultimately you will protect a man when it comes down to it.&#8221; And there is nothing to say to that. There is a lot of mistrust. As you may know, the whole rape crisis movement was started by lesbian women, so too the domestic violence prevention. So they always thought they were the real feminists, and it was an interesting struggle to be right in the middle of. I'd like to think that I bridged some of that.References 3-4 - 0.55% CoverageReproductive choice was my real issue. I said then and I say now that unless and until women can control whether or if they become pregnant, we don&#8217;t have to talk about equal pay for equal work.

We joined a temple, and I joined the rape crisis service because I had done that in Madison. In Madison you could take shifts, and they would, you could be home, and they would forward the calls to your home. I would take it when Rebecka was napping. I went to Southern California and I was already seasoned. I got together with the most amazing women, and I&#8217;m still friends with a lot of them. The San Fernando Valley Rape Crisis Center was so pure that we wouldn&#8217;t take money from any local municipal government, nothing. It was great because we could decide what we wanted to do. If a man called in those days, we had the name of a psychologist, a man, who dealt with either men who were rape victims or men who were trying to deal with their significant other having been raped. But we wouldn&#8217;t touch them. I was not talking to a man because a lot of times they were just crank calls. On the other hand for a woman we believed everything she said. Whatever she said we were going to believe her. We were going to start from that point and we were going to validate her feelings because whatever you feel is normal after something like that. And so I did that for many years. LL: Was it hotline and did you have a center as well where people would come? PW: No, there&#8217;s never a physical space.

So I decided, nobody asked me, I just decided that I was going to run for lieutenant governor, and it turned out to be a good experience<Files\\WOL\\WOL_Gray_Twyla_Mason> - § 2 references coded  [6.63% Coverage]Reference 1 - 3.22% CoverageOh, sure. I don t even remember what the content of the bill was, but 9 there was an old gnarly guy named Bill Bradley who was the head of Banks and Banking, and Bill was about 157 at that time and he introduced me and said, you know, There s this little woman from Tulsa County. We re gonna let her talk about her bill before we kill it. Yeah and of course they did, so there were those kinds of experiences. One of the lessons that I learned from my husband was that I was not so much interested in whether my name was on the bill, but on what happened, and so there were a lot of pieces of legislation that I handled on the floor or I did the roll calls on because I cared about the topic. I worked on th bill that allowed for prosecution of spousal rape. People do things to each other that frankly I had never heard of or thought about before I went to the legislature. And I worked on a bill that was a, rape by instrumentation. There were lots of bills that I worked on.Reference 2 - 3.41% CoverageOh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It s a huge difference. For a lot of those guys, they had never worked with women before. If they d been ranchers or they d been farming, they really hadn t had a lot of contact with women. We know that people tend to stay with things that they re familiar and comfortable with, and so there were men there who thumped the Bible and who said that they had a biblical entitlement. I ll never forget a senator on the spousal rape bill saying that if he didn t rape his wife, he d probably never have sex. We were doing a child support bill and a guy in the Senate was saying, Does this mean that, you know, if you have a one-night stand you re responsible for the child? I just can t imagine that, and I thought, You can t be that ignorant. But a lot of it was based on what I clearly believe is misinterpretation of the Bible and ignorance. So when people tend to hang out with folks that are just like them, they re going to hang out with other guys and to throw a woman into that mix, they re really uncomfortable.<Files\\WOL\\WOL_Hamilton_Rebecca> - § 2 references coded  [14.63% Coverage]References 1-2 - 14.63% CoverageOh, yes. Yes. I had tremendous help. Representative Mike Fair, he s a republican, but he was a tremendous help to me. Representative Charles Gray was a big help. Most of the other representatives from south Oklahoma City tried to help me. Frank Shurden representative he was a representative then he later became a senator and so did Mike Fair, he became a senator later. They both tried to help me. Of course I met my husband here and he didn t exactly take me under his wing, but we certainly formed an alliance, I would say. We ve been married a quarter of a century (Laughs) and raised two kids. I remember my first bill was a bill legalizing it made rape by instrumentation against the law, which had not been illegal before, and it made it illegal for a man to rape his wife. Well, that s kind of a 9 Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton bombshell to put out on back then, those were really controversial ideas, very much so. I can imagine. So I talked to the different legislators about it and they were all men that I was talking to about it and said, I don t know what to do and I m scared to go and I was, I was. You don t know what it s like standing up on that floor. There s a world of difference between watching a car wreck and being in one and standing up on that floor is a lot different when you re actually the one holding that mic. I mean, it is scary and they all come at you and ask you questions. They can really make you look like a fool, which is something most people fear a great deal. I told them, I said, I don t know what I m going to do. I don t We sat up here one night late trying to figure out how to help me pass that bill. And what we did, and I ve never told anyone this but I don t think he would mind now, I had another bill doing something or the other I don t remember what and they were both out on the floor. And Frank Shurden said, Well, what we ll do is I m going to amend your bill to put my castration bill in it, and then there s going to be this huge fight. He said, Then you run your bill making spousal rape against the law right after that, and they ll be so exhausted from the fight over the castration bill, they ll just pass it and never even notice what they ve done. There were about four or five of us who were involved in this genius plan, and that s exactly what we did and it worked. And it worked? And it worked. When I got the thing through the House, I couldn t find a Senate author to save myself. They would not touch it, and finally Frank Keating stepped up. I ll never forget that. He was a senator at that tim, and I had been through everybody in both parties, and I went to Frank and he said I still remember this because this was my first bill and I was a scared kid and he said, Of course I ll help you. What you re doing is right and it needs to be done and, yes, I will help you. I have never ever forgotten that about Frank Keating and so anyway yeah, I had a lot of help. Has it gotten any easier to do bills on the floor? No, it s much harder now. Oh, you mean handling things Yes. on the mic and stuff? Yes, it s easier. I know what to do. It s always 10 Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton scary when you stand up. You never know what s going to happen on that floor, but no, I don t get petrified before I handle a bill on the floor anymore, if that s what you re asking. Have you had any other bills that just stick out the ones you re proudest of? Well, I was the original author of the Protective Order here in Oklahoma. It took me two years to pass that back in the day and the major reason why is because it took me that long to get the chips to pass it. That was a big coup because that was just unthinkable to pass that here. That, I guess, and my first I also got this capacity hotline for rape victims here in Oklahoma. I got the funding it wasn t a piece of legislation, but I got the funding to set up the first statewide it was five pilot programs around the state for adult daycare. Okay. And I was one of the people who worked on nursing home reform, and back then nursing homes really, really, really needed reforming. Then when I came back, I ve done a lot of things in my second go-around that I m really proud of, too. Can you tell us about those? Well, I remarked earlier that I was pro-choice in my first time in office. Well then I had a very powerful religious conversion, and when I came back I was pro-life which has been the source of a great deal of controversy surrounding me. As part of that process, I was the primary author of the House Bill 1686 in 2005. That was the bill that broke the log jam. There was a 30-year log jam on pro-life legislation, and getting that through changed that. Now a big part of that change was the republican takeover of the House. It changed the climate quite a bit, too but it took all of us. I think that s something that people don t realize. We desperately need both parties to be working together on things that matter and not trying to shoot each other down all the time. That s terrible for the people, terrible for the country. I passed that. Let s see I passed a bill saying that you couldn t put rape victims private information on the Internet, which I thought was very important. I passed another pro-life bill, and both of these bills required informed consent before abortion. They required parental consent for minors. The first bill said that if you murder a pregnant woman you can be charged with the death of the baby as well as the death of the woman. Then the second bill basically dealt with funding and some of those issues. I passed that. There again, that was actually Representative John Wright s 11 Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton bill, but in order to get it through I had to author it at the final thing, and that s an example of both parties working together. I really don t know that I passed that bill. I stepped in when I needed to step in to get it through. I passed a bill this year making it a crime to beat up a pregnant woman, which only took me five years. Only five? Only took me five years<Files\\WOL\\WOL_Leftwich_Debbe> - § 1 reference coded  [6.13% Coverage]Reference 1 - 6.13% CoverageAre there any other special issues you want to go over or anything that s happened? Yes, why not? (Laughs) Go to it. You can all read about someday what I did accomplish. Of course, when I first came up here my first goal was to finish some things that my husband wanted to finish his last term. He had just gotten reelected in 2002 before he became ill. And so one of the programs that took me two sessions to complete was the graduated driver s license for teenagers. He had worked on that for a couple of years so I worked on that pretty hard and we got that done. The other one is a trucking bill that he had and this is one I had a hard time following. (Laughs) So I at least got some other senators involved in it and we were able to get that done. It was to help get kind of a one-stop shop for truckers to get licenses and other things in one agency instead of spread out over two or three, which was just costly and time consuming. So they did get that done. Another group did that. A couple that I haven t finished yet, is on driver s license programs in public schools. We had them for years and now we ve quit having them, then they started coming back and then they re gone again. And that s because of the money and the driver s license education fund. I m going to try to work on that again this year because it s a reimbursement program. If schools don t get reimbursed sufficiently, they re not going to carry the program, pure and simple. So I m going to look at that. Another one that I ve started that Keith did work on some was trying to create a aging department to consolidate all of senior s services because right now they re spread out over six or seven agencies. That just doesn t make any sense to me. This is something very high on senior groups lists your area-wide aging, your silver-haired legislature and other senior groups, AARP, this is pretty high on their list. And so I ve had that bill up there for a couple of years and I m still working on it. I think we re going to see a little movement on it this year, I really do. We ve got some additional groups involved and interested and some more legislators interested in it too. Another one is domestic violence. I ve got a real passion for domestic violence as far as trying to do something about it in Oklahoma. It just gets me that it s still a misdemeanor for a first-time offense. And if anyone knows anything about domestic violence, you know it s happened more than once before it ever gets to court, before there are 20 Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich ever charges filed. It is a violent crime, first and foremost and yet we are not making that first-offense a felony. But yet we re filling up our prisons with all these non-violent offenders. I have a real problem with that. One of the scenarios I use is in Oklahom it s a felony to own a fighting rooster or fight dogs but it s a misdemeanor to hit your wife. I am hoping in the time I m here, that Oklahoma is going to stand up and say, Enough is enough. That We re not having any tolerance for domestic violence. And help me push that through the legislature and get that done. In addition to that, it s important to also give some economic security to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. That s another bill that I ve been working on.<Files\\WOL\\WOL_McDaniel_Jeannie> - § 2 references coded  [2.23% Coverage]References 1-2 - 2.23% CoverageWow, that s hard to say. I mean, I always voted in national elections but I never really thought republican or democrat. Having been a single mother for a while, without an education, I probably always and having had a heart for the under-served in our community and the disabled and disenfranchised, I suspect I was always a democrat and didn t know it. But when it came time to register, I always I ve never voted straight-ticket. So I would always look at the people and learn as much as I could. But, I actually became involved in politics when in 1981 I went to work for a young woman at the time named Susan Savage. And Susan and I ran the Crime Commission. It was a non-profit which dealt with crime prevention and community safety. We chugged along as any non-profit does, making it month to month, raising money and serving the community. It gave me the opportunity to visit homes all over Tulsa. And most of these people were victims of crimes. I volunteered for Call Rape at the same time and set up a close relationship between the police and myself and learning how to teach people to protect themselves and prevent from being victimized again. Sort of teaching them to be Bob the Builder and have a toolbox of common sense and ideas and things they could use. So it gave me the opportunity to be in apartment complexes, economically challenged neighborhoods dealing with everyone from prostitutes to the disabled to those who were mentally disabled to the very wealthy. And that was a great education for me.<Files\\WOL\\WOL_Peterson_Pam> - § 2 references coded  [5.65% Coverage]References 1-2 - 5.65% CoverageWell, there are certain votes, there s things that happen kind of quickly that you want to get a pulse on your caucus, where they re at on a particular issue. The Speaker needs to know how his caucus is on a particular issue and uses the Whips to get that feedback from the members of his caucus. And talk a little bit about committees that you ve been on. Well, my first committee assignment was as chairman of the CareerTech Committee. That was a great experience because I learned a lot about that system and what a jewel it is in Oklahoma and how it s recognized worldwide. We have subcommittees now under the new leadership and regular committees, so CareerTech has been incorporated into the Higher Ed Committee and currently I serve on that committee. I chair the subcommittee on Children and Families. I also serve on Human Services and serve on the subcommittee on Criminal Justice. And I chaired last year the task force to stop sexual violence. And then out of the task force you usually come up with bills to present? Yes, and last year we came up with a bill that actually passed and is current law, which I m real pleased with, dealing with the CLEET Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training hours, the CLEET training hours, the police hours. What we found in the course of the task force was that police officers were not sufficiently trained in rape and sexual violence cases, and many times felt a little insecure going to those kinds of when they had to be called in to go to those 12 Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum reports. And so we thought, Wow, we can certainly improve that system by increasing the CLEET hours for sexual violence training. So we ve got, I believe, six hours now in addition to the CLEET hours that we have for all police officers in the state. I think that s a positive change. And we tried to get a coordinating council. There s some ongoing things that we re looking at that we weren t able to implement right away, but as you know, it takes years to make changes. It s a process. It s a process, yes, and I think it s important to keep that perspective.<Files\\WOL\\WOL_Weedn_Trish> - § 2 references coded  [3.00% Coverage]References 1-2 - 3.00% CoverageWell, I guess the first very emotional, controversial hard decision that I voted on was the House Bill 1750. That was the education bill, where they increased taxes to fund education, a very, very controversial bill and just barely passed. And Governor Bellmon was in. I was so pro-education and I wanted to do whatever it took to get the best possible education for our children in the state and I knew that we had to do something. But you had to think at the time that if you voted for a tax increase then you probably wouldn t be back. That was the decision that I had to make. I felt like whether I came back or not, it was the right decision, and that was the most controversial bill. What is very passionate to me and very important to me was partial birth abortion, to stop that. I was the author and it passed. In Oklahoma, there could not be any partial birth abortions performed. Being a democrat woman was very controversial, received a lot of phone calls and a lot of letters about how disappointed they were that I was a woman, number one, and that I was a democrat. But again that was my heart, it was my passion, and I am pro-life. I m very open to the life and death of the mother and incest and rape but as far as just for birth control, I don t agree with that. That s where I stand. Everyone knew where I stood, and that was another issue that was very controversial at the time.<Files\\WOL\\WOL_Williams_Penny> - § 1 reference coded  [1.84% Coverage]Reference 1 - 1.84% CoverageYes. Joan Hastings and Helen Arnold, both republicans, had already been in the legislature, but there were three new democrats. We had a total it was our all-time high a total of five women legislators in the House from Tulsa. Alene Baker and Twyla Mason and I were the three new ones. All Tulsa area House members , except for Joan Hastings, supported the Equal Rights Amendment. At any rate, there we were, we women, sitting in this committee on the judiciary. We actually were on the subcommittee of juvenile justice. That was my interest, policy for young people, but we were part of this larger committee of the judiciary. A legislator by the name of Frank Shurden had this bill he became known as the legislator who was for castration for those who had committed rape. At this point, he had the bill that called for alternate death sentences for criminals, convicted criminals. They could choose 12 how they were going to die, how they would be put to death. I kept listening to this bill and these other women on the committee, these big Equal Rights Amendment supporters, who were saying, Oh, yeah. Great. That s just so American, you know, freedom of choice. I was thinking, What is wrong with this picture? So I finally got up my nerve and asked my first question, and that was, How would you write the job description for the executioner? I mean, we re talking about people. One of the lines of the bill was, You may choose to die in the way you did in your victim. It was kind of screw-y language, and then everybody started looking at the language and so, finally, we defeated the bill, the alternate death penalty bill. But it was just a strange bill. So then I found out that I really could ask a question and that questions can sometimes lead to the right outcome if you just find the right question. (Laughs) So I spent a lot of my time thinking of the right questions. But
