And apparently, the Dixiecrats were running for office and so, immediately I got hit by this, you know, overwhelming white political power structure. Some blacks had started, I think, probably in the early 1950s running for office, but it was just a thing that people did with no hopes of winning. I think Dr. [Joseph E.] Walker had run for the school board and maybe somebody had run for public office of some kind and what not. But there, we became, my husband [HM Russell Sugarmon, Jr.] and I became very involved in the political campaign and then also in the struggle for civil rights. Immediately, we joined the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], starting going to meetings, the NAACP was being overhauled, it had very old non-progressive leadership. At the time we got to Memphis, which was 1956 a lot of northern educated young professional blacks were coming back to Memphis. There was Jesse Turner, who was the banker, who came from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]. There was A. W. Willis who came from Michigan [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan]. There was Russell Sugarmon, my husband who was from Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. There was me from Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts]. There was [HM] Maxine Smith who\\'d gotten a Master\\'s at Middlebury [College, Middlebury, Vermont]. Suddenly, there was Vasco Smith, who had gotten his doctor, D. D. degree. So, there were doctors and lawyers and people who, we were supported by the black community, you know; any time you have dentists, and doctors, teachers, nurses, whatever. Our financial support came from the black community, so we felt like we could afford to step out there, we ain\\'t had no money, but we had lots of umpf, lots of energy and we got involved in politics. Immediately, let\\'s see, Maxine and I had our babies. The next summer she and I applied to Memphis State University [later, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee], which had no, this is, this is 19--, let me see, I went there in 1956; this is 1957. The Supreme Court decision was 1954 [Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas (1954)], this is three years later. She and I applied, oh it created a furor, ahh the people were really upset. Finally, they decided we were not qualified, (laughter) in spite of the fact that I finished Wellesley, she had a Master\\'s, she said, \"I didn\\'t even want to go there.\" It was just something that, you know, we had to do; so we were unqualified. In the meantime I was getting nightly calls from people who said they were on the football team and if I came out there, they were come and rape me. My husband and I lived on Lenow Alley [sic, Place, Memphis, Tennessee]. His parents lived on Walker [Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee] right across from the college [LeMoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee] and his father, bless his sweet soul, built us a little one bedroom, tiny little house on their back property, which faced onto the alley. So, one night we woke up and there was a gunshot through the window, people fired onto the thing. So, we were not afraid for ourselves, but we sent our kids, I sent-\\'cause I had two babies at the time and we sent them, the little girl up to Saint Louis to stay with his sister for a good part of the summer cause we were afraid for the children. So, you know, there were threats and what not. But we kept on, we were completely fearless. Then, in 1959 Russell ran for the County Commission [Shelby County Board of Commissioners], and all of us were really active; I mean door-to-door, campaigning, up late at night, up early in the morning, speaking in churches, rallying, just, we really just became caught up. Now, in that race we really did think blacks had a chance to win. Unfortunately, he was defeated and the other two, one of them was [HM Benjamin] Benny Hooks, one of them was a minister, Reverend [Roy] Love and so the three of them were defeated. But, we were not discouraged, we were determined and I think people realized at that point that there was this movement which was now manifesting itself in different ways.

We never used infantile terms for parts of human anatomy.

The only man that she really excluded for the possibility that I might experience this was my dad. So, after this was over, I went home, and I remember my parents were sitting at the table. And I walked in telling (laughter) what had happened, and, and I told them exactly what had happened. And my mother said, \"I have to get a docto\\n to examine you.\" I said \"No, don\\'t want you to do that because he--we didn\\'t have intercourse.\" I knew that, but she got the doctor. And I remember falling asleep, and when I woke up, my dad and the boy\\'s father were in the room. And I remember being embarrassed because all I had on was a little blouse, and I was lying on top of the covers, and I didn\\'t have any panties on. I guess I had fallen asleep as soon as the doctor left. And the first thing I heard was the boy\\'s father saying to my dad, \"Look what your wife did to my son.\" And my dad said, \"Look what your son did to my daughter.\" Later on I found out after mama was satisfied with the doctor\\'s exam, she had taken a baseball bat, and gone to his house, and called him out, and then she was beating him up with the baseball (laughter) bat and put him in the hospital.

Somebody broke into her room and raped her (shakes head). Speaker 2: Now, this is somebody with another label? Speaker 1: Yes, another label. So, thank you, Berry. He took darn good care of us.

And you don\\'t think that you\\'re going to end up with \"Nigger, go home\" signs pasted all over your door, and pictures of guns and rifles, and your neighbors telling you to go back where you came from, and all those things that happened to me when I was there. And because I was there virtually by myself, it was very frightening to me. Speaker 1: What neighborhood did you live in? Speaker 2: I lived in the Fenway area. I lived on a street called Hemingway across the street from Northeastern Illinois University. Because there was-- Speaker 1: In Massachusetts? Speaker 2: In Massachusetts. Did I say Northeastern Illinois? Speaker 1: You said Northeastern Illinois. Speaker 2: Northeastern University. Speaker 1: In Massachusetts? Speaker 2: In Mass... in Boston. It wasn\\'t the BU neighborhood, but it was close enough. I could walk if I felt like a long walk, or I could take the streetcar and it wasn\\'t very far. It was something that I could afford that was, I thought, near my school. No one told me that I was the first black person to live in the building. Because I had no trouble at all renting it, I didn\\'t expect any problems. I looked at the place and I said, \"This is fine.\" I filled out the application, gave them the money, they rented it to me. No warnings. So, it was a big shock to me to have that experience. There were other experiences that I had when I was there. And so it meant-- Speaker 1: What are some of the things that happened? Do you want to talk about them? Speaker 2: I was followed... lots of things. I had... my sister in Detroit [Michigan] had to send me mace, because it was against the law to have it in Boston.

But I met a family there and the man was being abusive to his three-year-old daughter, and I am sure it was clear on my face that I didn&#8217;t approve. She had hit him, and he had hit her, and then she had hit him. But he was hitting her until she had red splotches all over, and he had been drinking, and I could tell the mother was really upset. We were in a very remote picnic area. It was getting dark and the man offered to go up and let me look down and see if I could see my compatriots, and if I didn&#8217;t I was going to go back into - I was up near Cookville, Tennessee. Anyway, without the gory details, he ended up beating me up and raping me, and I was twenty one at the time. But the thing that has ended up about that experience is that I had never had a violent experience before, never been in a violent situation. My parents were very gentle people. Most of the people I knew were gentle people, so I had never come up against violence in that way. But what he kept saying-and he was almost in a trance-what he kept saying over and over again is that &#8220;I have killed women and children in Vietnam and I can crack your neck with one hand.&#8221; He just kept saying that over and over about Vietnam. He was a Vietnam vet. Later I commented to someone, they said, &#8220;Who raped you?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;The war.&#8221; Because I really came to see it that way. I didn&#8217;t prosecute because of my father&#8217;s health. I actually ended up knowing who he was because his wife had given me his business card, because she liked my dog, and she had no idea. I think she must have sensed that something happened, because I took him back and I was all beaten up, and I just let him out of the car and drove off. He had no idea that I had his business card in my pocket. I just could not do that to my parents. They would have never gotten a night&#8217;s rest about me. It was hard enough for them for me to be on my own. But that is what has haunted me about that period of time. So I am very sensitive about violence towards women, sexual violence, but I am also sensitive about what wars do to people. I think if women made those decisions, as they do in some Native American cultures-in the Cherokee culture, it is the women who tell the men whether to go to war or not-I don&#8217;t think women would kill each other&#8217;s children quite so hastily. I just think that it is a sad situation that our world, and that our particular society in America, does not have as part of the tightest threads of its fabric the wisdom of women.

In fact, finally, I was cut off from my parents. I mean, my parents disowned me. You know, I always think, you know, you see these things on Oprah and all these kind of talk show places where they tell the happy-ending stories of incest survivors talking about it and their family reconciling. I wrote a review of Dorothy AllisonÌ¢åÛåªs Bastard Out of Carolina where I was not explicit about the incest in my family, but I said that I came from a family where incest was a part of that history, and that one of the things that was never talked about is what that did to women, between women. Not just between a woman and a man, or women and men, but women and women, because you never believed a woman would have your back if you were a, you know, a victim of incest, and you werenÌ¢åÛåªt defended by the women in your family. And somebody, I suspect in the anti-porn movement, send that Ì¢åÛåÏWomenÌ¢åÛåªs Review of BooksÌ¢åÛå\\x9d review to my family, and um, I got a letter from my father that said, you are no longer our daughter, and we disown you, and that was it. And they never spoke to me again. ANDERSON: So, you werenÌ¢åÛåªtÌ¢åÛåÓyou and your mom werenÌ¢åÛåªt talking about these very personal issues of violence and sex in your home when you were both active in a movementÌ¢åÛå?. HOLLIBAUGH: No. Or, we were very occasionally. My motherÌ¢åÛåÓ so that was kind of the ending. But we had times when we were close and not close. My mother never believed me around the incest, and never, I think, could never afford to hear me. Because it wouldÌ¢åÛåªve changed in a fundamental way, her relationship to my father. However that wouldÌ¢åÛåªve worked out, she wouldÌ¢åÛåªve had to be willing to risk it in order to believe me. I told her when I was eleven; she didnÌ¢åÛåªt believe me then. I told her again when I was twenty, she didnÌ¢åÛåªt believe me then, and I, you know, blah, blah, blah. But around violenceÌ¢åÛåÓ my mother once said to me that the only thing she ever regretted about my childhood, of how she raised me as a kid, was that she, was so out of, so physically out of control. And that it was the one thing she felt like she really would change, if she ever could do anything differently again. That she knew she hit me a lot, she knew she really was wacky, in the way that she was out of control herself and that she really was sorry for it. So it was clearÌ¢åÛåÓ and that was the end of that conversation, I mean, we never pursued beyond that. \\n\\nReference 2 - 0.41% Coverage\\n\\nwould kind of be thirdÌ¢åÛåÓ it would be an odd route. And my father actually called and left me a message saying he would be willing to go into family counseling. My father, I think actuallyÌ¢åÛåÓ I mean, my father knew what he had done, and my father, I think, was willing to look at it. But my mother was not. And I think that was because my mother would have been to blame, too. That she had not protected me and she had not defended me and she had not, she had not challenged my father. She had not done those kind of things. Which is a real differenceÌ¢åÛåÓ if you look at Bastard Out of Carolina at least DorothyÌ¢åÛåªs mom didnÌ¢åÛåªt think she was a liar. She didnÌ¢åÛåªt leave the guy, but she didnÌ¢åÛåªt think she was a liar. She tried to do what she could to protect her even though she was staying. My mother did not. My mother did something that I think is actually much more classic, which is that you claim the kidÌ¢åÛåªs wrong, and then you connect and kind of identify with the other adult, and you form a unit against the kidÌ¢åÛåªs exposure. And thatÌ¢åÛåªs basically what my mom did. And my dad, I think, when this all exploded, was willing to really look at it. I think heÌ¢åÛåÓ he and I had had many confrontations about this, itÌ¢åÛåªs not as though I hadnÌ¢åÛåªt said it directly to him. But as long as my mother couldnÌ¢åÛåªt tolerate this as a conversation in the family, there was no movement that he and I could do, really. And so it, really, it stayed at a moment where there was conversation, and then, they moved. And they cut everybody off and all of that. And I just decided, you know what? The truth about incest is it already gives people who perpetuate it way more time in your life than they ever had the right to. Way more power in your life than it ever had the right to, and I, you knowÌ¢åÛå? ANDERSON: You just decided to be done \\n\\nReference 3 - 0.38% Coverage\\n\\n You know, if, if they lived their lives, basically embedded in that bitterness, thatÌ¢åÛåªs their lives. ItÌ¢åÛåªs not mine. I feel like, incest is a profoundly horrifying set of experiences, over time. Not just in terms of what it does to you when itÌ¢åÛåªs going on. It has enormous impact over the course of your life. And the only thing you control as an adult coming to terms with it, is how it will, how it will intersect with the way that you understand yourself and the way that you live your own life. You cannot guarantee that you will come to terms with it in, in relation to the perpetuator or the other parent, your siblings, any of those kinds of things. None of those things are the markers that you control. The only thing that youÌ¢åÛåÓ as a feministÌ¢åÛåÓreally have, is the tool of understanding, trying to actually understand why something happened, and how youÌ¢åÛåªll live with that history. What it will or will not do to you, the choices it does or doesnÌ¢åÛåªt influence, the way that youÌ¢åÛåªll be yourself as an adult around a child. All of those are in your control. Beyond that, none of the rest of it is open to a singular understanding. And, so for me, I feel like, you know, I saw it rip our family apart over time. It ultimately meant that we could not stay united as a family because it couldnÌ¢åÛåªt be resolved. I think thatÌ¢åÛåªs quite classic. I think in fact, all those stories that arenÌ¢åÛåªt the happy ending stories, very often end like that. With people never speaking again, people never seeing each other again. People never together agreeing on the nature of that history. And that you have to live with that. Because that, because thatÌ¢åÛåªs not what you control. ANDERSON: Where did you find the tools? \\n\\nReference 4 - 0.35% Coverage\\n\\nHOLLIBAUGH: I actually think it was all of those things. I mean I came through a movement, meaning the womenÌ¢åÛåªs movement, that gave me the right to have that history without being ashamed. Because you do have terrible shame, I think, connected to it, and you do think that you participated in it. In fact, I actually think you do participate in it. This is a part of the feminist movement that, that I think we often havenÌ¢åÛåªt talked about enough, that in fact thereÌ¢åÛåªs oftenÌ¢åÛåÓ whether you desired incest or not, thereÌ¢åÛåªs parts of desire that play into the sexuality that happens. My fatherÌ¢åÛåªs hands were some of the, were the most beautiful menÌ¢åÛåªs hands IÌ¢åÛåªd ever seen. I know I desired his hands. Did I desire him to rape me? No, I did not. But there was a way that he has always been a sexual figure to me. Was that true when I was seven? Yeah. Was it true when I was eleven? Yeah. And so, you know, I donÌ¢åÛåªt like to leave myself out of my own history. Things didnÌ¢åÛåªt just happen to me as though I didnÌ¢åÛåªt have my own complex relationship to it. But feminism and the womenÌ¢åÛåªs movement gave me a context to speak about and explore my own interior world and my own damaged history. And that is an extraordinary gift and I think actually the womenÌ¢åÛåªs movement has given that to women, even though itÌ¢åÛåªs now kind of pop culture instead of politics, it still is a very different world to be, to be incested and to try and recover from incest than it was thirty years ago, or fifty years ago, like when my mother was trying to deal with all the stuff that she had gone through.\\n\\nReference 5 - 0.23% Coverage\\n\\nItÌ¢åÛåªs kind of disgusting butÌ¢åÛåÓ and when I got in the womenÌ¢åÛåªs movement the first period where I think my mother was really thinking of leaving my dad for the first time I was in a commune, and one nightÌ¢åÛåÓ you know, we were all sleeping in a million different rooms, and you know, it was like, those daysÌ¢åÛåÓ and I heard this woman in the room next to me having sex with somebody, and it sounded to me like my dad, and I got up the next morning, and it was! In my commune! And so that was one of the first times that I had a confrontation with my father about incest. And said to him, Ì¢åÛåÏI know what you fucking have done, and I know what youÌ¢åÛåªre doing now, and mom doesnÌ¢åÛåªt know it, and this is like, unacceptable, and if you want me to expose you, I willÌ¢åÛåÓ If you donÌ¢åÛåªt stop this affair, IÌ¢åÛåªm likeÌ¢åÛåÓ because this woman that youÌ¢åÛåªre sleeping with is in mom and myÌ¢åÛåªs CR group, so mom is like, in her fucking CR group, this woman whoÌ¢åÛåªs fucking you, this is like, unacceptable, sheÌ¢åÛåªs twenty, momÌ¢åÛåªs fifty.\\n\\nReference 6 - 0.18% Coverage\\n\\nHOLLIBAUGH: That was for my parentÌ¢åÛåªs benefit.

HOLLIBAUGH: Eleven or twelve. Um, and if you look at the pictures in my book you can clearly see a shift in how old I lookÌ¢åÛåÓ and it clearly happened, that was really, really, really a big crisisÌ¢åÛåÓ and there wasnÌ¢åÛåªt, you know, thereÌ¢åÛåªs nothing you can do about itÌ¢åÛåÓ your parents believe you or they donÌ¢åÛåªt believe you. But itÌ¢åÛåªs one of the more, itÌ¢åÛåªs one of the most isolating and kind of terrifyingÌ¢åÛåÓ because itÌ¢åÛåªs terrifying to bring it up and then itÌ¢åÛåªs terrifying to not be believed.\\n\\nReference 8 - 0.59% Coverage\\n\\n But in rural areas, a lot of dating is also driving in cars to isolated places and trying to figure out if youÌ¢åÛåªre going to have to fuck. So I started smoking because it was clear to me that in a bad circumstance, you could always light up, that was completely permissible, and when you were smoking a cigarette, it was very hard for a guy to come on to you, but you could also use it \\ns a threat. You could keep a person distanced from you by how you held it, blowing the smoke, I mean, it was just a tool. And, my entire family smoked like, smoked like chimneys, and so, it wasnÌ¢åÛåªt like I hadnÌ¢åÛåªt started smoking already trying it out, but I remember pretty consistently at twelve, starting to smoke, a lot. And that it was completely tied to dating and to fear about sexuality. Because I didnÌ¢åÛåªt actuallyÌ¢åÛåÓ I loved being sexually provocative, but I didnÌ¢åÛåªt particularly want to date. I mean, I didnÌ¢åÛåªt want to fuck. ANDERSON: Had you hit puberty at this point? HOLLIBAUGH: Yeah, IÌ¢åÛåªd hit puberty. And, but, I didnÌ¢åÛåªtÌ¢åÛåÓ you know, when incest is yourÌ¢åÛåÓ that doesnÌ¢åÛåªt tell you anything about sex, it just tells you about violation. So, itÌ¢åÛåªs not as though you know more, although youÌ¢åÛåªre not completely naÌÄåøve and you know, unaware of where a penis goes, but it doesnÌ¢åÛåªt really make a lot of sense to you. So, I started dating this guy. We didnÌ¢åÛåªt actually have sex, although we messed around a lot. Um, but he was really a protection, against my father. He was one of my fatherÌ¢åÛåªs friends. My father and he raced motorcycles together every Saturday; he was around all the time. He was somebody IÌ¢åÛåªd known since I was four or five. My mother wasnÌ¢åÛåªt too wild that I was twelve and he was 30 or 32 or something, she wasnÌ¢åÛåªt like, thrilled on that front. But I think actually they were both, they knew IÌ¢åÛåªd do it anyway. I mean, that was really the bottom line. But the other thing is, I think because theyÌ¢åÛåÓ I donÌ¢åÛåªtÌ¢åÛåª knowÌ¢åÛåÓ in working class life, age is not the same thing. I know twelve seems young, and I get that itÌ¢åÛåªs young, but my mother was married at fourteen. You know, so the assumption about how old you are and how you date, it just doesnÌ¢åÛåªt correlate in the same way. And I know that people relate that to trash to, you know, having no ability to protect your child and therefore theyÌ¢åÛåªre on their own, and itÌ¢åÛåªs part of whatÌ¢åÛåªs out of control about that culture. But I mostly think that you actually, you do grow up quickly when you have very little. And you know, people donÌ¢åÛåªt protest that you have to get a job when youÌ¢åÛåªre eleven, they protest that youÌ¢åÛåªre dating. \\n\\nReference 9 - 0.14% Coverage\\n\\nHOLLIBAUGH: There were things we never talked about, like incest and things like that. But it wasnÌ¢åÛåªt that I wasnÌ¢åÛåªt telling her the truth, itÌ¢åÛåªs that those things were never talked about, by anybody, to anybody. ANDERSON: Was the abortion, for example, something thatÌ¢åÛåÓ HOLLIBAUGH: Oh no, absolutely, I talked to her about it. ANDERSON: The sex work was still a secret from your political friends at this point? HOLLIBAUGH: Yeah. I mean, she knew I had been a dancer in Vegas. She knewÌ¢åÛåÓ if I told her about some part of my life, I told her the truth. But I didnÌ¢åÛåªt tell her about having been a sex worker.\\n\\nReference 10 - 0.83% Coverage\\n\\ndisconnected from the politics that? HOLLIBAUGH: Well, hereÌ¢åÛåªs what I felt like Ì¢åÛåÓ I mean, I had not started talking about incest until 1980 or Ì¢åÛåª81 when I met Dorothy. I had quietly said to friends and lovers what had happened to me or some version of that although pretty caut\\nously. But again, in the womenÌ¢åÛåªs movement when I would try to talk about my experience of incest, the class stuff was so sickening that I then ended up having to defend my father or my cousins or my uncle and say, or my mother, I Ì¢åÛåÓ so, when Dorothy and I met, and CherrÌÄå?ie was doing antiviolence work then, she was in New York and she was doing domestic violence work, IÌ¢åÛåªm sure. And that was her job. And so Dorothy and CherrÌÄå?e and I would spend a lot of time talking about it. But DorothyÌ¢åÛåªs who I first told the truth to, because DorothyÌ¢åÛåªs life around that and my life around that were really quite similar although in different places, but equal Ì¢åÛåÓ not equally but in all the ways that people donÌ¢åÛåªt want to deal with the meaning of it, they were violent and transgressive and relentless and all of that stuff. And so it wasnÌ¢åÛåªt shameful to talk to her about my own history and so I could finally think about it and talk about it and we started doing a little bit of work around it with CherrÌÄå?e. We realized the class stuff was so bad that we couldnÌ¢åÛåªt figure out how to talk about without it instantly kind of sinking into a class discussion that we didnÌ¢åÛåªt have any tools for and that there was no markers around. So, people would Ì¢åÛåÓ felt completely free to comment on what they thought of your family. And I think parallel to that at the same time was the Ì¢åÛåÓ I donÌ¢åÛåªt even know how to say this, but the accelerating aspect of feminism that made your victim status the most relevant totality of your experience, that you never had a relationship to your own oppression, that you never had a complicated relationship to what was done to you, that you never participated in it in any way. In order to try to say that women had not been asking for rape or incest, we went to a place that was really dangerous. (cough) Do we need to stop? Anyway, the tragedy of the attempt to reclaim womenÌ¢åÛåªs lives by making us victims so that we could assign responsibility where we thought we had been powerless, and so we could reclaim womenÌ¢åÛåªs right to, you know, claim that they were raped even though they were married, or incested even though they had been provocative little girls, you know, all of that kind of stuff, I think, had a terrible ultimate impact on where feminism ended up. Kind of making its arguments for what happened to women and what you had to think about. And that became an impossible place for me.

I know I remember one evening it was about sexual abuse, and I had not thought about it since I was a child, but when I was twelve I was abused by a friend of my mom and dad&#8217;s, and it was horrible. It was traumatic. I had repressed it, and because we were talking about it in this group I remembered it, but I didn&#8217;t remember-&#8211;. I wasn&#8217;t ashamed of it anymore because every single woman in the group, every one, had either been raped or abused in some way, every woman. One friend of mine was talking about she was hitchhiking in her hometown and this guy that she knew picked her up and raped her, and I don&#8217;t think she even reported it. But it was everybody, so that&#8217;s such a good example of &#8220;the personal is political,&#8221; because when women are abused or raped, often we are ashamed of ourselves and we hide it, and my parents certainly never-&#8211;. I never told my parents. I never opened my mouth. I just turned into this really angry little girl for a couple of years and I hated my mother, because part of the way that I was raised in those days, adults were right and children weren&#8217;t. You respected adults and you weren&#8217;t taught, like kids are now, that it&#8217;s okay to tell if someone does something.

You know, itÌ¢åÛåªs not like I could actually see it, but I could hear. And you know, it just stayed. The image stayed forever. ANDERSON: Did you ever talk about it with her? VAZQUEZ: Not with my grandma. I actually Ì¢åÛåÓ itÌ¢åÛåªs an image and a story that I completely forgot about until I was in my thirties and some therapy thing Ì¢åÛåÓ and boom, there it was. And then, the detail of it really didnÌ¢åÛåªt come back to me until I wrote an essay called Ì¢åÛåÏSpirit and Passion,Ì¢åÛå\\x9d where I described the incident.

I mean, I remember my uncle that night, because I was crying and upset, my uncle holding me and taking care of me and telling me it was going to be all right. My uncle was maybe ten years older than me, ten or 12 years older than me, so he was, you know, a child himself, just a young teenager, and he had probably witnessed stuff like that before.

Did that translate to him, to you feeling afraid of your grandfather? Was he ever mean or abusive to the kids? VAZQUEZ: Yeah, because I think before that, we just sort of didnÌ¢åÛåªt have much to do with him. WeÌ¢åÛåªd avoid him. He was, you know, the gruff guy, whatever. And after that, I was afraid of him.

Gartrell: [00:04:30] When I was six years old, we lived next door to a physician who had three sons. One of them was a teenager. He and a friend of his lured me and my brother over to their treehouse and said, \"Wouldn\\'t you like to come see our treehouse?\"\\x9d He said, \"You go up first\"  to me and I started climbing, and I said, \"Come on, Greg\" [to my brother]. And he [the neighbor] said, \"No, no, you wait down there.\"\\x9d They wouldn\\'t let him up. They got me up there, and they had a .22 rifle and they pointed the rifle at me and demanded that I engage in sexual activity with them, which I don\\'t think there\\'s a point in describing, but it was phenomenally traumatic. I thought that they were going to kill me, and they threatened to come get me if I told anyone. What happened afterwards was I got down, and I burst into tears and ran to my home. My mother and father were both home at the time. My father examined me physically, which was further embarrassing, and then went over and screamed at the neighbors and told them he was calling the police. Then they consulted--I don\\'t know whom--who said that it would be very traumatic for me to go to court to testify against these boys, and it was better just to leave [it as it was, with] whatever threat my father made against them. We lived in that house for another year and a half. I was terrified every single day. I was terrified every single night. I was afraid they were going to crawl into my window. I actually was terrified throughout the rest of my childhood about the prospect of being raped or assaulted after that incident. Marine-Street: Were there any ramifications for the assaulters? Gartrell: [00:06:35] None whatsoever. When we moved to a new home far across town from where they lived, there was an unfortunate response on my mothers part to a question I asked in a veiled way, hoping that it wouldn\\'t be obvious why I was asking the question. I said to her, \"Do you think there\\'s any chance those neighbors know where we live now?\"\\x9d She said, \"Oh, of course, I\\'m sure they know,\"\\x9d which just took away any feeling of safety that I could have had at this new home. Marine-Street: Did you get any kind of counseling or help? Gartrell: [00:07:13] No. 18 Marine-Street: What did they call what happened to you in those days? Gartrell: [00:07:22] Teenage boys acting badly. Marine-Street: Has your understanding of that changed over time? Gartrell: [00:07:32] It was sexual violence at gunpoint and very, very, very traumatic. Marine-Street: You also mentioned to me that you almost were kidnapped. Was that about that same time? Gartrell: [00:07:48] It was a few years later. We lived next to a lemon orchard. Our house backed up against the lemon orchard. We were not a family of means. We lived in a small track house in Santa Barbara. Our school bus dropped us off about, I would say, a fifteen-minute walk from my home. I had seen a car that followed the school bus frequently, and it was an old man driving an old car. On most days when we were dropped off, there were many of us children. On this particular day, I was the only one. I got off the bus, and I was walking in a fairly leisurely way next to the lemon orchard to my home. This car pulled up next to me, and he rolled down his window, and he said, \"You need to get in. You need to get in.\"\\x9d He looked very frightening to me, and I started running, and he started following me. There was enough room where he could follow me off the road. I started screaming and running, and I ran through the lemon orchard [so] he couldn\\'t take his car through the lemon orchard. I got into my house the back way and went into my room and looked out the window, and I saw that he was cruising by trying to find me. I told my parents. They then called the police and they allegedly looked for this person, but I [often] saw the car [parked] within a mile of our home and no one ever apprehended 19 the person. It was another instance in which, again, there was a complete lack of feeling safe. Marine-Street: What did you do as a child after those instances to kind of make yourself feel safe? Gartrell: [00:09:57] I didnÌ¢åÛåªt feel safe. I felt frightened all the time. I felt frightened in my home, outside of my home. I was always afraid of being raped. I was always afraid of being assaulted. Marine-Street: How can you function if you\\'re always afraid? Gartrell: [00:10:12] There are a lot of things that contributed to fear in my life and my parents unfortunately were not psychologically healthy. There was major mental illness in my family so I had that factor contributing to my state of not feeling safe. My father had severe panic disorder, and he was pretty much afraid of the world and afraid of going anywhere. When you have a role model of one parent who is afraid of the world and another parent who was quite mentally ill in a different way, it\\'s not an environment in which a child grows up being given an opportunity to feel safe. On top of that, I then had teachers who hit on me before I left for college. For instance, when I was a tenth grade student, I had a Latin teacher who said to me he wanted to start driving me home. I thought that I needed to comply with that, [but when I] told my father and mother, they said, \"Well, he can come here and meet us, but he\\'s not driving you home.\" He touched me in ways that were very creepy. Touched my body and his hands were not where they should be. I mean, here I was doing well academically and having somebody trying to paw me and trying to drive me home.\\n\\nReference 2 - 3.19% Coverage\\n\\n Gartrell: [00:37:33] IÌ¢åÛåªll say something about encounter groups. The summer before we entered Stanford, to my knowledge, every one of us received a letter offering the opportunity to participate in an encounter group when we arrived. It was described as an opportunity to have a member of the Counseling and Testing Center meet with a small group of us to talk about our experiences and to get to know one another well and share things that we might not feel comfortable sharing just in general. But, you know, in a safe environment. I read it. My parents read it. At first I thought, Ì¢åÛåÏWhy not, it sounds good.Ì¢åÛå\\x9d My parents read it and thought, Ì¢åÛåÏOh, wow, free therapy. Great. So do it.Ì¢åÛå\\x9d I signed up to do it and we met. In my group, for some strange reason, my RA who happened to become my lover was in my group but there were no other women. There were about five other men and then we had a male who was a member of the 32 Counseling and Testing Center staff running the group. We met in Escondido--in one of the Escondido apartments--I donÌ¢åÛåªt know if theyÌ¢åÛåªre still called Escondido Apartments. Are they still called that? The tall buildings that are across from the firehouse. Marine-Street: I think they are--Escondido, yes. TheyÌ¢åÛåªre doing a lot of reconstruction up there right now. Gartrell: [00:39:00] I know. EverythingÌ¢åÛåªs changing. There were apartments that senior students could live in. So two women who were seniors lived there, and they allowed us to use their apartment. It was clear from the very beginning that the conversations were going in the direction of sex and talking about sexual feelings and that was something that seemed to be thrilling to the men to be able to do and felt creepy to me. Early into these meetings, we were told to pair off and there were all those kinds of touchy-feely things that were done back then in group dynamics where you close your eyes and, you know, see what you can communicate to another person through holding their hands like this and things like that. That kind of pairing off, we were given some instructions about that. I found out later that the woman who became my lover, my RA, and the man she was paired off with--what he did was he reached around, undid her bra, and was feeling her breasts during that encounter. That made me feel incredibly freaked out. She didnÌ¢åÛåªt complain. She just went along with it. She was sexually involved with men before she became involved with me. I guess, I donÌ¢åÛåªt know, some number of sessions later, we arrived and the group leader was on the couch holding the hands and stroking one of the women 33 who lived in the apartment. He said, Ì¢åÛåÏWell, letÌ¢åÛåªs resume later.Ì¢åÛå\\x9d She went into the bedroom, and we started our meeting and he stopped it after, I donÌ¢åÛåªt know, five or ten minutes. And he said, Ì¢åÛåÏYou know, I have some unfinished business to do with whatÌ¢åÛåªs-her-name and so why donÌ¢åÛåªt you carry on without me.Ì¢åÛå\\x9d We kind of, I donÌ¢åÛåªt know, carried on somehow without him. I had to go to the bathroom, and I got up to go to the bathroom, and the door to the room was open and they were having sex. And I, from other women classmates, heard similar stories of power and sex abuse by these people who supposedly represented mental health professionals affiliated with Stanford, which was just appalling. Marine-Street: Was he a student? Gartrell: [00:41:43] No, he was a member of the Counseling and Testing Center staff in the Dean of Students Office at the Old Union. Marine-Street: The girl that he was having sex with was an older student? Gartrell: [00:41:55] Student, yes. She was a senior. Marine-Street: But an undergraduate? Gartrell: [00:41:57] Yes. Marine-Street: Well thatÌ¢åÛåªs an encounter group I guess. Gartrell: [00:42:01] Yes, thatÌ¢åÛåªs an encounter of a sort. Marine-Street: Yes, of a sort. Anything else on that topic? You wrote somewhere that it was Ì¢åÛåÏan environment of daily sexual harassmentÌ¢åÛå\\x9d during that time. Gartrell: [00:42:14] Yes. It was. Another illustration of the kind of commentary that was just routine and so irritating when it happened was initially when I got there, I guess miniskirts werenÌ¢åÛåªt in fashion yet, but they kind of became in 34 fashion. I wore skirts and shorts. I wore a lot of shorts while it was hot and then I wore skirts some of the time. Actually, they were culotte skirts so that they were kind of like shorts. And my skirts got somewhat shorter as time went on because that was the fashion. I happened to generally make my own clothes because we didnÌ¢åÛåªt have the money to buy them. As I came out and became involved in--or had much more awareness of--feminism and got really excited about the beginning of the second wave of feminism, I started changing my clothing style and wearing clothes that were comfortable, not clothes that attracted attention from men. Because my short skirts--well, I mean, I figured all women attracted attention from men--but I felt that the way I dressed attracted attention and it was unwanted attention. I started wearing comfortable clothes that felt so good and so safe. That included overalls and turtlenecks when it was cold. One of my classmates said to me, after I had started wearing these clothes, turned over to me before our class started and said, Ì¢åÛåÏYou know I liked you a lot better when you were wearing miniskirts. You really look terrible in overalls.Ì¢åÛå\\x9d Marine-Street: This is a male classmate? Gartrell: [00:44:26] A male classmate. Marine-Street: How did you respond? Do you remember? Gartrell: [00:44:29] I just looked kind of horrified and I felt just invaded, and I felt it was an indication of this kind of entitlement to dictate the clothing of a classmate and very aware of the difference in my feeling of safety wearing overalls and a turtleneck versus a short skirt.\\n\\nReference 3 - 4.09% Coverage\\n\\nsomething that happened then? Gartrell: [00:49:00] Yes, we were told periodically about rapes that happened and women being assaulted outside our dorm. This was starting our first year at Stanford. The lighting was very poor. Our bikes were parked in really dim lighting. I already came to Stanford as a frightened person--worrying about assault and violence. This was not helpful to me at all. We did, as our peer group of women, talk about our fears of going to the library at night. I was petrified of going to the library at night because it involved going out to get my bike where it was dimly lit, where anyone could be grabbed, riding my bike through dark streets to the library, and at both of those places locking the 37 bike. All of these things, if thereÌ¢åÛåªs nobody else around, made me quite vulnerable and then being in the library, studying until whatever hour, and then making my way back. I was petrified. I mean, from the moment I left the dorm I was petrified. The whole process of thinking about going to the library made me petrified, which meant that I didnÌ¢åÛåªt go as often as I wanted to or needed to, which meant that I felt that my [education suffered]. Well, I mean, it was my choice about safety or my fears about safety that prevented me from making adequate uses of the library. At that time, there were no [alarm boxes]. I know now that it seems like every twenty feet, thereÌ¢åÛåªs an alarm box and I also know that there is [00:50:53] a lot of attention to safety. IÌ¢åÛåªm not talking about the kind of safety that involves drinking alcohol and saying no. IÌ¢åÛåªm talking about just trying to go to the library or trying to go to a night class. I mean, there were things that were happening at night that unless I was going as a member of a group, it didnÌ¢åÛåªt feel safe attending. Marine-Street: Did you and any of the other women students do anything to try to feel more safe? Gartrell: [00:51:25] No, we just didnÌ¢åÛåªt feel safe and--I mean, it didnÌ¢åÛåªt occur to us that we had an opportunity to do anything. Marine-Street: Was there any kind of like self-defense courses or anything? Gartrell: [00:51:37] I donÌ¢åÛåªt remember what year it was, but I think it was probably my senior year that a self-defense course was offered, not as an elective but just as a campus activity, and I took it. I found out about it however--going to school at a time when there was no internet, any information you received 38 was word-of-mouth, you happened to have the time to read a flyer in White Plaza, or you happened to have time to read the Stanford Daily, or you had access to the Daily regularly, which I didnÌ¢åÛåªt always, especially if I was living off-campus. It was really a matter of luck if you found out about something that you really wanted to do and needed to do. But somehow I found out about it. I attended this class and I loved it. I loved the concept of being taught that I was entitled to pay attention to my fears and that whenever I did feel afraid--whenever something happened that made me feel more afraid--I should pay attention to my feelings because they were a good indicator of my potential risk. My lover who had sex with men before she met me, [and] had sex with men throughout the time she was with me--she was not comfortable being lesbian, didnÌ¢åÛåªt want to identify as lesbian, wanted to get married, [and] spent the whole time that I was at Stanford looking for a man to marry at the same time she was involved with me--always said, Ì¢åÛåÏOh, youÌ¢åÛåªre just a wimp, you know, stop being so afraid. What are you so afraid of? YouÌ¢åÛåªre so afraid of sex with men? Why are you so uptight? YouÌ¢åÛåªre just incredibly uptight?Ì¢åÛå\\x9d Always the message, Ì¢åÛåÏYou are really, really uptight.Ì¢åÛå\\x9d To have this validation in this self-defense class that paying attention to [my feeling of fear]--granted, I came from a background of more fear that I carried within me than I wish I ever did--but that if something kicked it up to a higher level, that my feelings were valid and I needed to pay attention to them and I needed to do something about them immediately. Then to learn self-defense techniques to fight or to fight back or to release myself was 39 fabulous. It was such an incredible opportunity to have--to create a sense of empowerment. Marine-Street: Was it a male instructor, do you remember? Gartrell: [00:54:27] Absolutely not. It was all women. Marine-Street: All women? Gartrell: [00:54:29] Yes, I wouldnÌ¢åÛåªt have taken a course from a man because how could a man possibly have come from our experience and seen the world in the way we saw the world? Marine-Street: It was another student that was doing it? Do you recall? Gartrell: [00:54:45] Yes, I believe it was another student or somebody from offcampus who came. Marine-Street: Do you remember where they taught the classes? Gartrell: [00:54:52] They were taught in the Roble Gym. Marine-Street: Does anything stick with you about what they taught you like specific techniques? Gartrell: [00:55:03] They were techniques about releasing yourself if someone grabs you and there were techniques about the most vulnerable [ways] to fight back if you were assaulted. I go from that, fast forward to many years later when I got to know Pauline Bart who was a very eloquent writer about rape and women fighting back. She did studies about women who were trained to or learned to fight back versus women who were trained to lie down and take it. I had heard always growing up that if youÌ¢åÛåªre assaulted; youÌ¢åÛåªre going to be killed if you fight back--until I took this class. 40 When I got to Pauline BartÌ¢åÛåªs readings and then got to know her as a colleague and heard that there were actual data that the women who fought back, very often, got away and were not raped versus those who submitted were a hundred percent raped. There was no guarantee they werenÌ¢åÛåªt going to be killed. It was an incredibly eye-opening experience. Marine-Street: IÌ¢åÛåªll say. LetÌ¢åÛåªs take a quick break. Gartrell: [00:56:29] Okay. [End of Part 1 of 5 - Interview with Nanette Gartrell - August 29, 2018] 41 42 STANFORD UNIVERSITY PROJECT: STANFORD PIONEERING WOMEN ALUMNAE ORAL HISTORY PROJECT INTERVIEWEE: NANETTE GARTRELL INTERVIEWER: NATALIE MARINE-STREET DATE OF INTERVIEW: AUGUST 29, 2018 PART: 2 OF 5 Marine-Street: Before we move on, is there anything else youÌ¢åÛåªd like to say about the selfdefense course? Gartrell: [00:00:06] One other thing that just came to mind is in Pauline BartÌ¢åÛåªs research about lying down and taking it versus fighting back--and fighting back included using strategies to extract yourself. There were accounts that she provided of women who actually talked men who had weapons out of their weapons and then managed to escape without being assaulted. ItÌ¢åÛåªs really quite phenomenal but not only did she find that if you do fight back or use a strategy to escape that you have a chance of not being sexually violated. But even if you were raped and you fought back, that the psychological sequelae for those who resisted versus those who didnÌ¢åÛåªt was dramatically different. That is fascinating. That was always fascinating to me. The fighters ultimately did better than those who thought that they had to comply and didnÌ¢åÛåªt try any strategies. Not that theyÌ¢åÛåªre to be blamed-those who are to be blamed are the police and the men who told us, Ì¢åÛåÏDonÌ¢åÛåªt 43 resist, donÌ¢åÛåªt resist.Ì¢åÛå\\x9d They are to be blamed, and I have strong feelings about that. \\n\\nReference 4 - 1.05% Coverage\\n\\nGartrell: [00:23:53] I guess I would say that my entire career has been one in which the personal is the political. Even most recently, the great fear that a person who demonstrates signs of mental instability has access to the nuclear codes made it very clear that there was great urgency to try to protect the planet. But long before that, my goals were to make this world a better and safer place and provide civil rights for LGBT people. That has been a mission throughout my career and will continue to be. [My sex abuse work became a parallel track]--also more than a decadeÌ¢åÛåªs worth of work--because I just happened to fall into some knowledge about [physician] abuse of patients and power abuse. That [line of work] became a very big theme in my life. And it recurs now as weÌ¢åÛåªre in the #MeToo movement. [All around us] we see the 129 incredibly positive changes that are occurring as women are speaking out about abuse. My interview began with your questions about my experiences of abuse as a child. At one point you asked how did I get through those experiences and manage to keep on going. I have to say that I donÌ¢åÛåªt think anybody who has gone through abuse could probably answer the question of why we made it to the next step other than at first, weÌ¢åÛåªre [just] trying to survive. And then [of course itÌ¢åÛåªs incredibly fortunate] if we can garner resources, [perhaps] have the privilege and the good fortune of having something like a Stanford education with access to really smart and talented people, and [then take a] look around at movement activists who have the strength and [talent to] create communities to make changes and work for social justice. IÌ¢åÛåªve had the privilege of knowing amazing community activists who have created phenomenal change and [forged] paths to so much social justice in our world.

I don\\'t remember what church I went to, if it was St. Matthew\\'s [St. Matthew Catholic Church, Flint, Michigan] or if it was St. Michael\\'s [St. Michael Catholic Church, Flint, Michigan]--oh, it was a church, it was a Catholic church in East Lansing [Michigan], because I was at Michigan State [Michigan State University] at the time, and he wanted me to give him details. I said, \"You know I have kissed and I\\'ve, I\\'ve been fondled up--,\" you know, because we\\'ve been told that we have to confess everything and you know of course, I had not had full blown sex, but you know I\\'d done everything almost, but you know and so when I was, I was saying that he said, \"Well, like wow, how many times did you kiss?\" I was like, \"I don\\'t know, father.\" \"Did he touch you?\" \"Oh, yes father.\" \"Did he touch your breasts?\" \"Oh, yes father.\" You know, \"Well how many times?\" And I started like hearing him like breath heavy and so then he asked me to, to wait for him after he finished the, you know, the confessions and then he wanted to talk to me, and I remember sitting outside, it was like in the spring. I remember sitting outside of this church on a bench and this priest coming out and I noticed he was like really sweaty and he took my hand and he was like, \"My child,\" you know. I don\\'t know what he said but his hands were all clammy and I was like, I mean I\\'m like, dude, but I was like, \"Sorry, father.\" He says, you know, \"I need to have some one on one time with you to help you to cleanse yourself.\" And I was like, I\\'ve been down that road. I was molested from like the age of twelve, I was molested like, four times. I was raped twice. So, I\\'d already--so I knew that one. I knew that story (laughter). So, I was like, \"Oh, no, I\\'m not going.\" Speaker 1: This by, by a Catholic priest? Speaker 2: It was a Catholic priest. Wanted to give me some one on one sessions. So, thank--well, you know thank goodness, I\\'d had other incidents in that regard that I knew, but when he grabbed my hand with my hand it was oh so clammy, he was breathing hard. I don\\'t know if I\\'d given him an erection or not, but I knew it was wrong. Story_ID: 659977 Speaker 1: You wanna tell that story? Speaker 2: Sure, there was a priest at St. Matthew\\'s [St. Matthew Catholic Church, Flint, Michigan], his name was Father O\\'Grady [ph.]. He was--not only, he was, he was a horrible man. He was an alcoholic; at that time the church which was almost like a small cathedral, they had installed a mic [microphone] system because you couldn\\'t hear the Mass if you were in the back of the church, and when he would receive the Blood of Christ (laughter), the altar boy would, would tip you know the little cup. I think they used to drink Mogen David wine, I don\\'t know, and he\\'d, you know, pour the, the wine into the chalice and the priest would always--Father O\\'Grady would always hit the pitcher so that the altar boy would pour more wine in, and then he would drink it and I, I don\\'t know why nobody ever told him that when you drink and if you, if you sigh, we\\'re gonna hear it all over the church. He would drink that wine down and he\\'d go (makes sound). (Laughter) Oh lord and when he would get the, you know receive the, you know, Blood of Christ before he would give out the, the first communion, same thing, (makes sound). But I saw him on at least three occasions feeling up the novice nuns, going up under--they had these long white bibs that they wore that was part of their habit, going up under there and feeling their breasts and just having them pinned up against the wall in between the, the convent and the church rectory and there was this narrow little wall-way, hallway or walkway rather, and I saw him do this like three times and then I was told by someone that there were a lot of, of abortions, I mean a lot of aborted bodies that were buried on the grounds of the convent. Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw, (unclear) say that about (simultaneous). Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then there, you know we would have the strange disappearances of some young nun, she\\'d be in school one day and then I mean and then she wouldn\\'t be at, at the school anymore, and you wouldn\\'t see her at the convent anymore and I suspected those were the ones that were getting pregnant.

Speaker 2: I had a--I had my science teacher really, really like me and he would always allow me to come and work on my, my science projects and he would get close to me but I--like I said, I\\'d had all these incidents happen to me so I knew how to move away.

Story\\n\\n'), ('SCVF_Acey_Katherine', '> - ¤ 1 reference coded  [5.26% Coverage]\\n\\nReference 1 - 5.26% Coverage\\n\\n IÌ¢åÛåªm trying to think. I think that I was a senior and she was a junior. I think I mentioned, my sister and I have lived in the same city, in very close proximity, for all of our lives, except for about two years when she was in graduate school out in Texas and Arizona. Rosary Hill was, as I said, in the suburbs, and there was no transportation. The buses ran, but they stopped at a certain hour. Buses didnÌ¢åÛåªt even run, I donÌ¢åÛåªt think, on the weekends. So the college culture in Buffalo Ì¢åÛåÓ not just at Rosary Hill, and probably in the United States, I would imagine Ì¢åÛåÓ was you hitchhiked. I remember hitchhiking from Buffalo to Albany to go see somebody. You know, we were hitchhiking together. My first years, before I moved off campus, I had a job off campus, and I would hitchhike to that job, and once a guy exposed himself. I used to carry a knife actually, but I donÌ¢åÛåªt know what I thought I was going to do with it. ANDERSON: But you still didnÌ¢åÛåªt think you were gay? (laughter) ACEY: It had a nice little leather holder. ANDERSON: Yes, I was going to say. ACEY: I forgot about that too. God, you know, the things that come back to you are amazing. So it was a culture of hitchhiking, and people were careful. I eventually stopped hitchhiking by myself. I didnÌ¢åÛåªt think it was such a cool, you know Ì¢åÛåÓ But sometimes you just got desperate though, you had to get someplace. Nobody had the money to have cabs, and it wasnÌ¢åÛåªt like New York where you just, you know, put your hand out. My sister and her roommate were going out for the evening to a bar, and they left campus and they hitchhiked. They got picked up by two guys, who drove them near where they were going, but pulled into the driveway at the state hospital, which is this big Ì¢åÛåÓ massive acres and trees and deserted and dark Ì¢åÛåÓ you know, long driveway. My sister and her roommate were in the back seat of a two-door car, and when they went to let them out, her roommate got out, they pushed her, and they drove off. Her roommate got hysterical and called the police when she got somewhere Ì¢åÛåÓ I canÌ¢åÛåªt remember Ì¢åÛåÓ and got some help. I worked my way through college. I mean, I had some scholarships and my parents helped me, but I always held down a job. I donÌ¢åÛåªt know how I did that. I used to take a lot of classes, be involved in politics, and work. I just donÌ¢åÛåªt know how that all happened but it did. I was probably a crazy person then too. ANDERSON: Yeah, it was the pace that you set a long time ago that you still have. ACEY: I was running the student union that night and there was a dance. I got a call to come to the police station. I was with these close women friends, and I didnÌ¢åÛåªt have a jacket, it was chilly. My friend gave me her leather jacket and said, Ì¢åÛåÏWear this.Ì¢åÛå\\x9d And I went off, and I got to the police station and found out what had happened to my sister. SheÌ¢åÛåªd been beaten and raped. SheÌ¢åÛåªd been found in a park. There was an alert out, that she was in a park that was closed, with these guys, and the police were just doing a routine run-by of the park, and they saw this car and they investigated. So my sister was traumatized. There was a woman police officer talking to her and then to me. The guys who had done this were African American, and the police were saying some really outrageous Ì¢åÛåÓ So it was this, really, another one of those conflict-ridden, contradictory situations where both she, who is, like, bruised and beaten Ì¢åÛåÓ She was a virgin. She might have been a sophomore or a freshman. I donÌ¢åÛåªt know, (inaudible) personal history, anyway. So we got into an argument with the police officer, who had begun to make some racist statements, and I made the comment that, Ì¢åÛåÏHow can you say this? I was with friends, this jacket belongs to my friend.Ì¢åÛå\\x9d So I just said to them, Ì¢åÛåÏLetÌ¢åÛåªs just leave this, letÌ¢åÛåªs just get out,Ì¢åÛå\\x9d because she had to get to the hospital, get all these tests. WeÌ¢åÛåªre talking late Ì¢åÛåª60s, maybe 1970s. I canÌ¢åÛåªt remember if I was of legal age, because I am a year older, but we basically didnÌ¢åÛåªt want my parents to know what happened to my sister, because we felt it would kill them, knowing that sheÌ¢åÛåªd been raped and brutally beaten. To this day we donÌ¢åÛåªt know. There were all kinds of knives and axes in the car, so we donÌ¢åÛåªt know if they intended to kill Ì¢åÛåÓ ANDERSON: So you were trying to protect your parents from the pain of that. ACEY: We were trying to protect my parents, which was, you know, probably the very wrong thing to do. And then within days, my mother and my aunt were coming to visit, and now this became a big thing. There was a big newspaper article that someone had been raped from campus. Nobody knew, so there was all this buzz on the campus. My sister is not in a great shape, weÌ¢åÛåªre trying to keep this from our parents. My aunt and mother arrive, and we go out and do something and we come back to my sisterÌ¢åÛåªs room, and sheÌ¢åÛåªs on the phone sobbing. What the police had done is to call my father and told him that his daughter was brutally beaten and raped, and his other daughter Ì¢åÛåÓ they made up some kind of story, and I canÌ¢åÛåªt remember. Again, IÌ¢åÛåªd have to ask my sister exactly how it went, but they got in that his other daughter Ì¢åÛåÓ they got in the leather jacket and all that, but they kind of made it something else. ANDERSON: And African American friends too. ACEY: Yeah, they kind of made it an ugly story rather than how it was. So then here we are, my mother and Anna want to know whatÌ¢åÛåªs happened and why was my sister crying. So that was like completely Ì¢åÛåÓ And Joanne, well, she had to go through three trials. She already had left Buffalo and gone off to graduate school, and they were flying her back. I think the first trial was a hung jury, and the second trial they were convicted, but then they got off on a technicality, an appeal. And then there was a third trial, at which they were, in fact, convicted. One, I think, ended up serving a few months, the other a year. So, ah, it was, you know, a big thing. I think I went through a lot of denial, you know? ANDERSON: Yeah. ACEY: A number of years later, I began to be more in touch with the feelings about it. Now I Ì¢åÛåÓ you know, fast forward Ì¢åÛåÓ I have become involved in the womenÌ¢åÛåªs movement, through reproductive rights and sterilization abuse work, and then anti-sterilization abuse, and also antiviolence, womenÌ¢åÛåªs antiviolence work, mostly around sexual assault and rape, but also somewhat around battered women. They were different organizations at that time, but the women who were doing the antiviolence work were very connected. Some are involved in both. So it was years later that I got more connected to what had happened, because I think I went into a very Ì¢åÛåÓ denial: [it] happened, [itÌ¢åÛåªs] over. You know, I felt like my sister needed to get some help. Initially she did a little counseling, but she really never, I donÌ¢åÛåªt feel Ì¢åÛåÓ The resources werenÌ¢åÛåªt there. She was treated terribly by the defense attorneys, treated terribly by the medical folks. There was no one place that I feel she got what she needed, and I think even from me. My parents were devastated, but again, there wasnÌ¢åÛåªt a lot of discussion about it. So years later I got more in touch with what had happened, kind\\nof the hugeness of it. ANDERSON: Through the movement or through other personal work or therapy? ACEY: In working within the womenÌ¢åÛåªs antiviolence movement. By the time I got involved with it, there were many lesbians, women of color. It was about organizing and advocacy but also services, but it was also about personal. So the more exposed I got to people working, but also women who had experienced some violence, the closer it got me to, like, begin to get better in touch and to begin to take in that experience in a whole different way. I remember distinctly one conference where there was a session that was women of color only, to talk personally. The opening question was, WeÌ¢åÛåªre going to go around the room, and I want each person to Ì¢åÛåÓ if they can Ì¢åÛåÓ relate an experience of their own or of someone close to them or one they know. I remember there might have been about 40 women in the room. Every single woman had a story, and I was totally overwhelmed by it. Again, this is years later. WeÌ¢åÛåªre maybe talking at least ten years later, if not more Ì¢åÛåÓ probably more Ì¢åÛåÓ since my sisterÌ¢åÛåªs rape. I just remember just sobbing and sobbing, and then I started to talk a little more to my sister. Well, now weÌ¢åÛåªre talking, you know, well over 30 years ago. It still feels like it didnÌ¢åÛåªt get completely processed, if you will, so. \\n\\n'), ('HM_Dyson_Marcia', '> - ¤ 1 reference coded  [2.07% Coverage]\\n\\nReference 1 - 2.07% Coverage\\n\\nWe were there for three years. But that remind me of something. Can I go back to 1969? A really pivotal moment in my life, I call it (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixty-nine [1969]? Okay. Speaker 2: Yeah. One of my best girlfriends went away to school and we had known each other since I was twelve years old. She went to Southern Illinois--Southern Louisiana University [sic. Southern University at Shreveport] in Shreveport, Louisiana. And so I took my second flight ever in my life down to Shreveport, Louisiana. And there--now I\\'ve gone through some black experiences, [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis is my icon. I go down to the South in the \\'60s [1960s] with an Afro, short pants, tight t-shirt with the peace sign, in a place that still---where people if you were black, had to dress up with some form of docili- being docile and with servility if you were going downtown. You had to be in your Sunday dress. But I didn\\'t do that. In going to the stores, women would tell me, the white women would say, you know, \"Baby, you aren\\'t from here, are you?\" Because I wasn\\'t saying, \"Yes ma\\'am.\" I wasn\\'t giving them the proper southern props. And my best friend\\'s grandmother lived way in the country. And she lived in the outback with the outhouse. And I decided one day being the adventurous Marcia [HistoryMaker Reverend Marcia Dyson], to take a bike ride on the country road. And on that country road looking at the trees and glistening, I went and stopped at a little country store, just like out of Spanky [George \"Spanky\" McFarland] and \\'Our Gang,\\' the ragged screen fence, the little store and the eggs on ice and a little boy, black boy with a striped t-shirt was buying six eggs. Not even in a crate, just had six eggs, holding them and put them on the counter. And was looking in his pocket and threw the money on--put the money--was gonna put the money on the counter. And I told the little boy, \"Boy if you giving the man your money, you can look the man in his eyes.\" And the little boy looked at me kind of head cocked like I was crazy. He threw that money on the counter, grabbed those eggs, put them whatever cloth, maybe his mother--and ran out the store. And again, this man in the store said like, \"Girl, you must not be from here.\" I was like, \"No, I\\'m not from here, I\\'m from Chicago [Illinois].\" Now forget Emmett Till, forget--and I\\'m this big, black girl with the black experiences. I have seen some things, I have seen Fred Hampton killed. I know about Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and all this shuffling Negroes. This is not me, I\\'m this tough girl from the North. I am from Chicago. But I started riding that bike back home, back, bike back to her, her grandmother\\'s house. And on the way there, a car full of rednecks came behind me. Then they were beside me. And they were saying things to me that when I saw that sun glistening on the trees, I thought my mother [Rosa Fields Smith] would never see me again because they were gonna take me into those woods and I\\'m sure rape me. A school bus came with white children. And I pedaled that bus [sic.] to keep up with the school bus and cross that bus in front of it perilously, rather be hit than be snatched in the woods by those white men. And the fear of every black person that I had seen in the movies, that trepidation, that southern fear, took hold of me and let me realize that like they said about Malcolm X compared to Martin Luther King, I saw the South on a soapbox, they saw it from the struggle. And it was my comeuppance. I started respecting the struggle more, the southern experience more. I understood the fear because it was in me. And it humbled me, you know, a great deal.

We had very little to do with my paternal grandmother because she lived at that time what we felt was a long distance away. It was about 40 miles away, so. Of course, that was a long way away then. But my maternal grandmother lived just two miles away. And they made it very clear to all of us that you do not talk about this, that this is shameful, that itÌ¢åÛåªs bad, that it only happens to you. We didnÌ¢åÛåªt talk about it to one another within the household, what went on, because it was supposed to be kept a secret and it was the divide-and-conquer, which is very common with incestuous families, what happens. So we never talked about it. We didnÌ¢åÛåªt discuss it. It was just understood that you donÌ¢åÛåªt bring friends home, and mothers in the neighborhood knew that, they wouldnÌ¢åÛåªt allow their children in our house. They knew what went on. I was welcome to go to other girlsÌ¢åÛåª houses and stay overnight but we were never allowed to bring friends home.

So we were each operating a truck, and we had done that some, because we had three trucks at the time, so we took on a lot. We had a little trucking business of our own. And so, there were times when I would operate the truck by myself, and it allowed me to think, I think. You know, youÌ¢åÛåªre by yourself then and so on. And of course in Ì¢åÛåª89, that was two years, I think, after my niece had revealed that my father had sexually abused her. And at that point in time, I still wouldnÌ¢åÛåªt admit even to myself that we had Ì¢åÛåÒ that I had been abused. I just said, it didnÌ¢åÛåªt happen in my family. Yeah, it happened to other people, but it didnÌ¢åÛåªt happen to me. It might have even happened to my older sister or whatever. It happened to some of the others, but IÌ¢åÛåªm sure it didnÌ¢åÛåªt happen to me. And I just Ì¢åÛåÒ it was one of those things where if you donÌ¢åÛåªt allow yourself to think about it, you just say, IÌ¢åÛåªm not going to think about it. IÌ¢åÛåªm not going to think about, that it goes back further enough in your brain so that you donÌ¢åÛåªt think about it and you just Ì¢åÛåÒ itÌ¢åÛåªs like itÌ¢åÛåªs a cutoff there. And I say a cutoff, it was almost like there was a curtain drawn there, and yo\\n donÌ¢åÛåªt draw that curtain back. Because if you do, God forbid. And thatÌ¢åÛåªs what it was like. And then, it was almost like when I started to look at what was behind that curtain, there was just like a flood of stuff that came out. And that was all the stuff that I had just stored back there, and had chosen not to talk about it or not even think about for years, since I had left home as a child, really since the time I had been 13 or so. I just, you just donÌ¢åÛåªt think about it. It was very easy to do all those years, I think, because there was so much else going on. Harold and I were married and we had his family to think about because his father died. And then my family expected me to solve all of their problems. Whenever anything went wrong, they came to Wynona to solve the problems, and the same with HaroldÌ¢åÛåªs family. They came to him. So it was just Ì¢åÛåÒ you know, it was Ì¢åÛåÒ there was so much other going on. Then we had the trucks and we were on road and I ran the business, essentially. And I ran the business side of it and Harold did the mechanical side and ran that part of it. And then we shared the driving. So our lives were really, really hectic and busy. And at that point in time, I think I felt safe enough and secure enough, and was with Harold enough at that point in time so that I could be comfortable and talk about it, and really re-live some of the stuff that went on. And it was a hard time. But it brought Harold and I really close. FOLLET: It did? WARD: Oh, yeah. Because he was there. He was like my everyday shrink, someone that could Ì¢åÛåÒ was further enough away from it so it was like he could be almost an objective person about it. Not really, because in some ways, but in other ways he could be. In other ways, he could confirm things for me, too, because heÌ¢åÛåªd known me since I was 13. FOLLET: Right. WARD: I remember when I went to the doctor about whether I had a learning disability or not and I came home and said she wanted me to think about back when I was kid, you know, where there some things I was behind in developing. And I said, YouÌ¢åÛåªve known me since I was 13. What do you think? And he has this dry sense of humor, so he said, Well, youÌ¢åÛåªve always been a klutz. (laugh). And itÌ¢åÛåªs true. And itÌ¢åÛåªs more than likely because of the learning disability that I have, which was caused from domestic violence. My balance isnÌ¢åÛåªt good. ItÌ¢åÛåªs never been good. And I have a hard time with that. And so itÌ¢åÛåªs things like that that he has seen and realized about me, that others wouldnÌ¢åÛåªt have known, because heÌ¢åÛåªs known me for so long. But at that time, yeah, thatÌ¢åÛåªs when I really started thinking about it and studying about it and reading about it and realizing that this is what happened in our family. And of course, when my niece revealed that sheÌ¢åÛåªd been abused by my father and we went through that whole ordeal, then it was like my sisters and I were really close for a while, a period there, and then we just all pulled apart and went our own separate ways because it was so hard to deal with, so hard to deal with. And they had their families and I was on the road and all of that, and it was very, very difficult to deal with. And they didnÌ¢åÛåªt want to deal with it. Nobody wanted to deal with it anymore. Just the same thing as always had happened in the past -- put in on the back burner, itÌ¢åÛåªll go away and it wonÌ¢åÛåªt happen again. But I didnÌ¢åÛåªt let that happen. Instead, I delved into it, and I really wanted to find out what it was all about, and so I did a lot of research on my own. And this was before I was at Vermont College. Whether it was in a bookstore, because when we were hauling different loads, we were in the cities and so on and I could go to a bookstore or wherever and research a lot like that, or could buy books from on the road, and had time to read on the road, where they didnÌ¢åÛåªt and they didnÌ¢åÛåªt want to deal with it, and so I could pick up these books and read different books about it. I read Judith Lewis HermanÌ¢åÛåªs book Father-Daughter Incest. I read Carol Gilligan. I read her book and different books like that I was reading. ThatÌ¢åÛåªs when, I think, how I got my first look at feminism and women and that type of thing was through those books, through Carol Gilligan and Judith Lewis Herman, really. And they were on my own, when I was on the road at that point in time. And I wasnÌ¢åÛåªt doing it for school, I was just doing it for myself. The Courage to Heal book, I read that then. Other books about child abuse, and feminist books then, too -- Gloria Steinem and some of those things. I was picking them up and reading them on my own. FOLLET: You were. WARD: Yeah, while we were on the road. FOLLET: Do you remember any ah-hah moments of particular books or particular ideas that really hit home? WARD: Well, of course, Judith Lewis HermanÌ¢åÛåªs book Father-Daughter Incest was oh, my God, this is our family. You know, I really think I was at Vermont College before I really started talking about a lot of it. FOLLET: Hm. You talked to Howard, I mean Harold. Sorry. You talked to Harold and you did reading on your own. Did you seek any assistance or- WARD: When things got difficult and I was going through some of the childhood stuff, I saw a psychiatrist for about eight months or so, whenever I could. It was kind of once a week but not really. And just around the psychological stuff of whatÌ¢åÛåªs going on and how do I handle this and I donÌ¢åÛåªt want to see my mother and father anymore and confronting them about what went on and so on, and saw him for about that length of time. And the rest of it was really on my own. I had a friend in California who had Ì¢åÛåÒ she had gotten a lot into feminism and that type of thing and so different articles and so on she would refer to me and I would read them, and really started researching on my own on it. FOLLET: At that point, as you started to come \\n\\nReference 3 - 1.79% Coverage\\n\\nWARD: I think I thought, no wonder IÌ¢åÛåªm so screwed up. (long hearty laugh). Really, I think I did. I thought, God, no wonder. No wonder this and no wonder that, after what I grew up in, you know. And you began to filter that through. This is an example. I remember Harold, all the time we were working I worked in Hanover and he worked in White River, and he would come over, and I would walk down from Hanover and sit on the New Hampshire side of the Ledyard Bridge at the Connecticut River and he would have to come over and pick me up because I wouldnÌ¢åÛåªt walk across that bridge. I was deathly scared of walking across bridges with water underneath them. It was all right if they didnÌ¢åÛåªt have water underneath it. And I never knew why, never could figure out why, and one time, I remember I came in and he had dropped me off in Vermont. And Harold said, Well, how are you going to get across? I said, Oh, I can do it now. Because I had remembered a time when my father tried to drown me when I was like a year and a half or so old. He was giving me a bath and he was fondling me and I was protesting it and so, heÌ¢åÛåªd stick me under the water, stick my head under the water, and I almost Ì¢åÛåÒ I couldnÌ¢åÛåªt breathe. And once I remembered that and dealt with that happening and dealt with that fear, I can walk across bridges with water under them all the time now. And I said that to Andy. I said, You know, I wanted to just stand there, walk back and forth, back and forth across that bridge. And he says, Well, that probably wouldÌ¢åÛåªve been all right. TheyÌ¢åÛåªd have just brought you here anyways. (laugh) And thatÌ¢åÛåªs the different things that you learn that have stuck with you from what happened to you when you were a child, have come up and you deal with them, and then those fears go away. I could never figure out why I didnÌ¢åÛåªt want to stay home alone, and there were times when I would not. I would have someone come stay with me or IÌ¢åÛåªd go stay with someone, and it was all because of the fear of what went on in the nighttime, which is when my father usually abused us. And now, you work through that and I can stay in fine by myself. FOLLET: Uh, huh. WARD: You know, you just work through those things. What it did at that time was [phone rings, voice in background], it allowed me to have respect for myself, to have empathy that I didnÌ¢åÛåªt have before, so that was good. FOLLET: Yeah. Um, - WARD: It was about that time, too, that we left from New England and started going cross-country on the trucks and it was after we had dealt with my father. No, let me think. No, that was Ì¢åÛåª93. Oh, and see, we were on the road again, and that was when my niece revealed that she had been abused by my brother. And so during those years I had been doing all this research and so on and learning about child abuse and learning about families, incestuous families and so on (phone rings in background) and so again, the family all turned to me. But I had a good idea of what to do about it then. Much more than what they did, and I knew what needed to happen to help her, and what the rest of the family needed to do. Psychologically I knew. I knew about that. I knew about it being passed down through the generations and who abused who and those different kinds of things. I didnÌ¢åÛåªt know the law. I didnÌ¢åÛåªt know the law. I knew a lot of the psychological stuff I had learned on my own. I had learned about myself and about other people that went through it and so on.\\n\\nReference 4 - 1.62% Coverage\\n\\nWARD: By that time I had read about it and I knew what it was about, and when this happened, I said, This has to stop. I said this to myself. I said this to my niece, to my sisters, to Harold, to my sisterÌ¢åÛåªs husbands, to anybody that I could talk to. This has to stop. It cannot keep going on. It happened to me, it happened to you, it happened to you, it happened to you. This has to stop now. [speaks with emphasis, points finger] And thatÌ¢åÛåªs what propelled me into helping that case. The only way this is going to stop, I had researched that. I looked up a lot of stuff. How do I get help for Richie, my brother? He has to stop this. He has to get help. You know, I didnÌ¢åÛåªt see him as being a culprit or being a criminal. I know he was, thereÌ¢åÛåªs no question he was, and thereÌ¢åÛåªs no question my father was, but I saw it as a sickness. And everybody in the family did. And so I said, The only way heÌ¢åÛåªs going to get help, from what IÌ¢åÛåªve read -- I had read Salter, Anna SalterÌ¢åÛåªs book Treating Child Sex Offenders and Victims -- and the only way heÌ¢åÛåªs going to get help is to go to prison. ThatÌ¢åÛåªs where heÌ¢åÛåªs going to get help, and heÌ¢åÛåªs going to get in-house treatment that way. Otherwise, heÌ¢åÛåªs never going to get help. So I said, We have to put him in jail. And my sister wanted him punished, because he had abused her and then he had abused her daughter, and, you know, she really Ì¢åÛåÒ she wanted him to get help but at the same time, this is wrong, he needs to be punished. So that really propelled me after that to want to do something else. And we had this friend. Her daughter had been sexually abused. She had gone through SRS [Social Rehabilitative Services] and gotten a divorce, and sheÌ¢åÛåªd been sexually abused by her father and so through a mutual friend, we were talking, and she said she was working Ì¢åÛåÒ and she had gotten her BA and she said, You know, thereÌ¢åÛåªs this is Vermont College. You can go there weekends if you want, but I think theyÌ¢åÛåªve got something where you donÌ¢åÛåªt have to go but a couple of times a year, and you could finish then. So I said, Oh, all right. So I called and got information on it. She wrote me a recommendation. Another friend wrote me a recommendation, and I got in. And thatÌ¢åÛåªs when Ì¢åÛåÒ when I went to Vermont College, I think thatÌ¢åÛåªs when I really got exposed to feminism as such. I got exposed to more of Judith Lewis Herman, to more of Carol Gilligan. I did child development and started with some of the womenÌ¢åÛåªs, the way women look at -- Mary Belensky, WomenÌ¢åÛåªs Ways of Knowing. All of those books like that were written. Alice Eichholz, who was my professor and was about my age, a little bit younger, had me read all these books, (HaroldÌ¢åÛåªs voice in background) and thatÌ¢åÛåªs, I think, when my eyes opened up as to how unequal things are between men and women and how unequal theyÌ¢åÛåªve been. ThatÌ¢åÛåªs when it really opened my eyes to that. And, I realized when my nieceÌ¢åÛåªs case was going on, that if we hadnÌ¢åÛåªt had a woman judge, and specifically the woman judge that we had, it might not have turned out the way it did. \\n\\nReference 5 - 0.92% Coverage\\n\\n It really did, because the stuff I was learning on my own, a lot of that Ì¢åÛåÒ some of it came from Freud, and Bowen is not Freud. ItÌ¢åÛåªs the whole family, and so I began to understand that it wasnÌ¢åÛåªt just victim-perpetrator, that the whole family in some ways were involved. And what I mean by that is that one person in the family moves and it causes everybody else to move. ItÌ¢åÛåªs like a mobile. You move one part of it and all the rest of it moves. And that was part of the reason why when my family Ì¢åÛåÒ it was at that time when my family still was turned against me -- my mother, my father, my brother, my oldest sister, and how wrong I was and that the reason that Richard was in jail was because I had put him there and it was a conspiracy because I was mad at my mother and father for what they had done and that I was a liar and I was crazy and I was nuts and I was making up all of this and nobody wanted to believe or accept or admit what I said was true. Um, and those members of the family and a lot of the extended family members, too, that were still all bound in this horror of child abuse and spouse abuse. One of the things I learned from Bowen is if I can just stay my own, eventually others in the family will change, and that did happen. It happened Ì¢åÛåÒ I mean, my younger sisters and so on, they believed what I said and added to it, what had happened to them. And eventually, my brother came around and said, yes, there were other cousins and nieces and nephews that said, yes, weÌ¢åÛåªve been abused, too, and eventually my older sister admitted it and my mother has and my brother did before he died. Now there are more people in the family that admit it and say, yes, this happened, than the other that say, no. I really have just one uncle left that still denies.\\n\\nReference 6 - 0.13% Coverage\\n\\nWARD: And I think, you know, thatÌ¢åÛåªs what I thought about my own family, too. IÌ¢åÛåªm not going to see the domestic violence or the child abuse stop in the world, but itÌ¢åÛåªs stopped so that my great nieces and nephews now wonÌ¢åÛåªt [01:02:44: END TAPE 2].\\n\\nReference 7 - 1.53% Coverage\\n\\nWARD: I think itÌ¢åÛåªs because I want people to realize. I recently said, and this is an example, to an opposing client who has finally admitted that he abused his wife and is going into a battererÌ¢åÛåªs intervention program, and we were dealing with supervised visitation for this child, and I said to him, When you get into your battererÌ¢åÛåªs group, you talk with your facilitator. I will be happy to come. Because he was trying to say that the child was only 2 when the battering went on and she didnÌ¢åÛåªt really see any of it. So I said, I remember back, vividly, when I was 2 years old and there was abuse going on in my family. And when you get into your group, you ask your facilitator if I can come and talk to you in your group so that you will know what it feels like to be a child and have your parents abusing one another, I said, or to have your father beating your mother. I said, I will be happy to come and talk to you about that and read to yo\\n some of my writings about what that experience is like. I said, Then you will know what itÌ¢åÛåªs like to be a child and know what it feels like to be abused and how traumatic and how frightening it is. Because I think that is the way, if I can reach people with that message, that they will realize that it has to stop, that it canÌ¢åÛåªt continue on, because if it does, then thatÌ¢åÛåªs what weÌ¢åÛåªre doing to our future generations that we expect to take care of us and expect to take care of the world. So I think itÌ¢åÛåªs very important. I often say we will not stop street violence and we will not stop school violence until we stop violence in the home. Because as I said to you yesterday, even though things go on at school that you know are not acceptable at school and theyÌ¢åÛåªre acceptable at home, deep down inside you learn that itÌ¢åÛåªs acceptable anywhere, and you can bring it from the home into the school and onto the streets and so if you can stop it in the home, I think thatÌ¢åÛåªs the key to where it all starts. And, you know, if - the whole idea that women need to be equal with men and can be equal with men. One of the things that has always turned me against the Bible and against religion is that my father would quote from the Bible while he was, you know, the next minute abusing my mother or abusing one of his daughters, as if he were supported by the Bible for doing this, and would turn it all around. So for a long time I was against the teachings of the Bible, but now, I can look at it more objectively and realize that yes, itÌ¢åÛåªs very patriarchal, especially the Old Testament, which is what he would quote from, but now I can look at it and realize that that was the way he interpreted it. FOLLET: Did he quote actual passage to justify actual abuse? WARD: He would Ì¢åÛåÒ well, you read the Bible. Nowhere in the Bible does it prohibit father-daughter incest. It prohibits everything else Ì¢åÛåÒ brother-sister, um, mother-son, and everything, but father-daughter incest is not prohibited.\\n\\n'), ('UNCTWMS_Ross_Loretta', '> - ¤ 3 references coded  [4.99% Coverage]\\n\\nReference 1 - 4.11% Coverage\\n\\nMy mother was extremely repressed sexually and I did not understand why, but what was commonly known was that my brother, her last child, was born in 1955 and she stopped having sex with my father then and they still remained married until they both died. We didn&#8217;t properly understand why and as kids you don&#8217;t actually peek into your parents&#8217; sex life, but when I got the job at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center&#8212;and therein is a story&#8212;that&#8217;s when my mother felt that I was the child to entrust her history to. I had been there a couple of years before she opened up to me, just surprisingly on one phone call. She just said, &#8220;Loretta, I&#8217;ve never told any of y&#8217;all this but I need to share this with you.&#8221; I said that we were a farming family and one of the characteristics of a farming family is that multiple generations live in the same house, and so my mother had been sexually abused&#8212;and her sisters, by the way&#8212;by an uncle, and for my mother it happened from age eight to age sixteen when she got married to leave home, and that created a lot of sexual trauma in my mother that she never had any counseling for and healing from. The uncle ended up being in prison in a mental institution until he died, and even before my mother told me the story we got this notice saying Uncle Eli has died, and all the kids said, &#8220;Who is Uncle Eli? How come we&#8217;ve never heard of Uncle Eli? We know Uncle Jim, we know Uncle Eskie, we know Booker T.; how come we don&#8217;t know about Uncle Eli? How did we miss this uncle?&#8221; My mother said, &#8220;Oh, he was one of Big Mama&#8217;s children,&#8221; and that&#8217;s all she said about Uncle Eli, and nobody went to his funeral or anything. So Uncle Eli was like the big mystery but we weren&#8217;t curious enough to try to follow it up. Well it turns out Uncle Eli was the uncle that sexually abused all the girls in the family. So Mama never had a healthy relationship around sex and sexuality, and then when I became pregnant through incest, through a cousin, my mother went ballistic. She actually beat me for being pregnant. She was not healthy around sex and sexuality. I could never under&#8212;. And she did some really predictable but what seemed to be bizarre things at the time, like every time my father would take one of his daughters out&#8212;and me and my father were particularly close so I hung out with Daddy all the time. I was Daddy&#8217;s girl. Daddy was the light of my life and I loved him to death. I know I was his favorite child and he knows he was my favorite parent, so there was no ambiguity at all about our relationship, but my mother would get so angry. I knew the minute I came home whatever I did it was not going to be right, and they believed in corporal punishment, so if I didn&#8217;t wash the dishes good enough that night I was going to get a whipping. It wasn&#8217;t until years later that I put together her fear around an adult male having a child outside of her eyes. My big sister told me, &#8220;She did the same with me.&#8221; She was just paranoid and it wasn&#8217;t until she told us her story, after we were already in our thirties [Laughs] that we were able to put all the pieces together, because what seemed to be craziness was actually PTSD. CGD: Were you able to tell your mother about the incest? LR: I had to. CGD: Was she able to hear it and process it? LR: [Pause] I&#8217;m not sure, because she got terribly re-stimulated by it. She had blamed herself for her own so she blamed me for mine. We actually agreed that I would go to a home for unwed mothers. CGD: How old were you? LR: Fourteen. CGD: Okay. So, I&#8217;m thinking about Rickie Solinger&#8217;s book about unwed mothers, of course later time period, and the argument is that basically in the &#8217;50s there are very few homes for black unwed mothers, so what was your experience? LR: It wasn&#8217;t a black home but I was the only black girl at the home. It was a home run by the Salvation Army in San Antonio, near Trinity University, over on the other side of town. The Salvation Army ran a number of these homes across America. A little bit more skirt to the story, I had already received a scholarship to Radcliffe and, trust me, having Melvin baby, was not how I planned on becoming a mama. I was not planning on being a mama. He was supposed to be babysitting me and he thought it was a better idea to have sex with me, and he was a serial abuser. That was one of the things that I really challenged within my family, how multigenerational the incest was, and yet we couldn&#8217;t talk about sex and sexuality, and I challenged that. The minute I became conscious of it I started introducing this very awkward conversation into our family. [Laughs] Whenever I see a young budding niece I go have a conversation with their mama, with my brother, whoever it was needed to have a conversation, and they would dread me coming, because I would say, &#8220;You know what happened to me, you know what happened to Mama; we got to stop this in this generation here, okay?

I don\\'t think of them any longer as monsters because, you know, they were going through transitions as well and it\\'s just one of those things that happens in life that you just have to kind of like watch all of your children. You just have to watch your cousins, you know, and my, my parents they just had too many of us to watch all of us, you know, they just--couldn\\'t do it, they just couldn\\'t do it. \\n\\nReference 2 - 1.89% Coverage\\n\\n I remember one time, I was at the university [Mississippi Valley State University, Itta Bena, Mississippi], I got raped, you know, at the university, you know, it\\'s, you know. I remember I could go on and on with all these different things and--. I remember the parents of the kid who raped me, they pleaded to me, they said, \"Please, please don\\'t have him sent up on charges because it\\'ll ruin his life.\" And I convinced myself, without my parents\\' [Dorothy Amos Brock and Herman Brock, Sr.] help to drop the charges, you know. But, you, you get to a place that you think to yourself some of the things that happen in life they happen as a result of choices that you make and I know the choice that I made that day. I went into the male\\'s dorm, which I should not have done, and I don\\'t know what I could have expected, you know, as I look at it today. But that still did not give him a right to rape me, but-- Speaker 2: Right. Speaker 1: --but it is what it is, you know. Speaker 2: Do you regret not pressing charges now or-- Speaker 1: No, I don\\'t regret it. I\\'ll tell you why I don\\'t regret it because I think that I had to take a responsibility for what action happened that day as well as that gentleman. We were very young and it could have been consensual, but I did remember saying, \"No.\" But, I don\\'t think my life right now, I would be where I am now if I had gone through with that because you can really hurt other people and I, when I talked to his parents, his parents was, you know, it, it could have gone any, any way. It could, it could have been that I could\\'ve agreed just by going into the room. It\\'s just so many ways that you can look at it you know. And I know back in that day, you know, rape, rape is rape no matter what. But I do not remember saying to him, \"Let\\'s go to the next step.\" But I did go into his dorm, so a lot of that weighted on that, you know, in my decision. And when I dropped those chor-, charges, those charges being dropped was weighted on the fact that I could mess up his life and maybe mess up my life as well. So I weighed it on that and we both live good lives now, you know. I, I, went on to graduate from college, he graduated from college, he lives a prosperous life. But you know those things would not be there for him. I remember going to the c-, the jail in Greenwood [Mississippi] and seeing him behind bars, you know, that, that left a mark on me because I, I look at it now and look at how the systems are set up, you know, it, it\\'s gotta always be a place where we can come and meet and say, you know what, I made a mistake, you made a mistake. And I think at that time I wasn\\'t smart enough, but something inside of me was smart enough for me to recognize that I did not wanna mess up his life because a mis-, a mistake that the two of us had made. So when I moved from that point to there--and I later on went on to, to date a professor (laughter) at the university so, it\\'s, you know, I, I had a really good life as, you know, as a, as a, as a student at the university.\\n\\n'), ('HM_Chew_Vivian', \"> - ¤ 2 references coded  [1.71% Coverage]\\n\\nReference 1 - 1.02% Coverage\\n\\nSpeaker 2: You're absolutely right, you know, and then there gets to a point where there's bliss and ignorance because the people who you deemed to be heroes aren't heroes any more, they're secret keepers, they're liars and the deeper I dig, the deeper, deeper it gets.

GOLDMAN: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) MCNULTY: Politically. There was some organizing around sexual violence. The party line of the college at the time was that there was no rape on campus or there was no sexual violence here, which, based on my own experience, and that of my friends, I knew was complete bullshit. So there was some Ì¢åÛåÓ sorry Ì¢åÛåÓ agitation about improving campus security. And they did make some changes, like put up Ì¢åÛåÓ we had blue boxes. You know, every half-mile, there was a blue box, just in case when you got attacked, you were right next to a blue box. But I think that was about it. I canÌ¢åÛåªt remember anything else, at the time. GOLDMAN: If you donÌ¢åÛåªt mind me asking, like, what Ì¢åÛåÓ how Ì¢åÛåÓ what was the student perspective, or Ì¢åÛåÓ with you, between you and your friends, and, like, noticing that the administration was maybe denying the fact that there was (inaudible) Ì¢åÛåÓ MCNULTY: We didnÌ¢åÛåªt talk about it very much. There was a lot of what has since been labeled date rape going on. Just really ugly stuff. Now, maybe, because when I was in college here, the drinking age was eighteen. So youÌ¢åÛåªd have college boys Ì¢åÛåÓ young men Ì¢åÛåÓ coming in for the house parties. And there was just no control over drinking, at all. Everybody was of age, but there were no drink limits, no drink tickets. It was just a beer bathtub; everyone just completely getting drunk. And so, there were a lot of unpleasant situations at best, and I think a lot of what we would call now rape situations. And I know I came home one night from a party in the quad, and a group of very drunk men followed me. And I had made one of them angry at a dance, because I refused to dance with him. I said IÌ¢åÛåªd rather dance with my girlfriends. And I was probably not very nice when I said it. And they followed me home, and they tried to follow me into the house and attack me.

And my brother is--owns a photography business in Charlotte [North Carolina], and they\\'re both doing very well. My sister is actually now working at a methadone clinic, so she\\'s helping addicts get better. Which is wonderful \\'cause my sister has struggled a lot over time with, I don\\'t know, anxiety issues and a variety of things. She\\'s struggled a lot, I mean we were both sexually abused as children, and so she struggled a lot with that. And so I think it\\'s a wonderful place for her to be to help other people who are struggling. Again, it\\'s this resilience theme, right? \\n\\nReference 2 - 8.81% Coverage\\n\\n Speaker 2: So she moved to San Diego [California] with my stepfather, who was Paul Cremaschi, and he was my evil stepfather. You know, he was a--he sexually abused my sister [April St. John Keenoy] and I. I, again, these are things you don\\'t realize \\'til you\\'re older. So she was in Detroit [Michigan], a single mom with three kids, struggling to make ends meet. When she--I think she was still in school when my father [Lee St. John] first left and she had three babies and she was trying to finish her degree so she could be a teacher. She--the story she told me was that she was told by welfare that if she wanted welfare, she had to quit school. And I--those were the rules back then, I don\\'t know. And she didn\\'t want to, and the only reason, the only way she was able to stay in school was she got a loan from the Jewish Free Loan Society [JFLA]. So again she had, you know, because she had had the connections with the Jewish family, she was able to make this connection and get that help and stay in school, and finish and then get her teaching degree, and she started teaching in Detroit. So Paul Cremaschi came along and married her, and took her to San Diego. And when you think about that, she was, she was twenty-seven, he was sixty-seven when they got married. He was, he was preying on a vulnerable, poor black woman, far away from her family, with two young daughters. He married her and took her further away from anyone she had ever known, and was able to prey. He was able to prey on my sister and I for years without being caught, or stopped, or questioned, or anything. I believe now that this was, you know, something he did to probably hundreds of kids over the--his career, and he targeted us because we were vulnerable. And again, I think that\\'s gotta to be the story of so many young black girls. He was white, but he targeted a vulnerable, poor, single black mother with two daughters. Speaker 1: And did your mother ever know that this was happening? Speaker 2: The hundred thousand dollar question everyone asks. I used to say no. Because you don\\'t want to believe that. I think, probably the best way to say it is she had been so abused, she was fighting so many demons, she was sexually abused in her own childhood, and she never got healing from that. She struggled with so many demons about race, about that. She had seen lynchings when she was younger. She had a lot of difficult stuff going on in her head, and she tended to dissociate. So I remember telling her when I was eighteen that I was abused. And she basically said, \"Well, so was I. Get over it, move on.\" There was not a lot of warmth or sympathy about that. It was, \"Move on. I don\\'t really wanna hear it.\" And, and I think some of that is her guilt, right? She had guilt around it so she just, is like, and her own pain, right? It brings up all her own pain. So she dissociates separate. Years later when I wrote my first book, \\'Succeeding Sane\\' [\\'Succeeding Sane: Making Room For Joy In A Crazy World,\\' Bonnie St. John], that was the first time I mentioned in a book that I had been abused. And we were gonna go on \\'The Montel Williams Show,\\' and they called her up and said, \"We want you on the show.\" And you know, they were doing the pre-interview, and they asked her, \"When\\'s the first time you heard that she was abused?\" And she said, \"Well, this show.\" So she would continually forget. My sister tells a story that she was at an event, it was a community event with lots of people, and my sister said something about being abused. And my mother turned to her and said, \"You have abuse in your family?\" I mean, there was a dissociation that continuously went on. But the most painful thing for me, when I started doing my own healing work around this, and I started being willing to focus on it honestly, and process some of what had happened. There\\'s a story that my sister tells. I say it\\'s a story, you know, it\\'s, it\\'s true\\n She told my mother when she was nine or ten, that something--she got in trouble for doing something. And she said, \"This is because, this is what\\'s going on.\" She was doing something sexually inappropriate, and she said, \"This is why.\" And what she says is that mom said to her, \"Well, has it stopped? Is it not going on anymore? Okay, well then, forget about it.\" Basically, the same thing she said to me when I was eighteen, she said to April when she was nine. And I had heard that story, and I thought it was horrible. But I didn\\'t really process it, and it wasn\\'t until I was in my thirties, wasn\\'t until I was in my thirties that I did the math. If my sister was nine or ten, I was still being abused and nobody asked. Nobody checked. \\'Cause I was abused from the age of two to the age of seven. And so this question of, did my mother know, is complex. She had, she had issues. Story_ID: 521602 Speaker 1: How did it stop? Speaker 2: I went to therapy when my daughter [Darcy Deane] was young, and I had to. I had, what I had done, okay. I had literally forgotten about it. I had forgotten, erased the memories from the time that it happened until I was eighteen. And what happened when I was eighteen is my stepfather [Paul Cremaschi] died. And I\\'ve come to understand, if you read about it, that this is a common thing. That when the perpetrator dies, you feel safe enough to bring the memories back. And so, it\\'s the weirdest thing, because it\\'s not like one day you wake up and go, \"Ah. I was abused. Ah!\" You know, it\\'s like the best way I can explain of what it occurs, how it occurs in your brain is it\\'s like a path. Imagine that you live in a neighborhood and you walk around the neighborhood, and there\\'s this road, dirt road that kind of goes off. And you just haven\\'t walked down that path in a long time. You know it\\'s there, you know you were down there years ago, you know it\\'s there, you just never think about it. And so you walk past every day and you never go. And then all of a sudden, when you\\'re eighteen and you walk down that path, and you go, \"Oh, yeah. I always knew this was here, but I just never went.\" And so it doesn\\'t shock you. It doesn\\'t surprise you. You just realize, \"I remember this, and I haven\\'t remembered it for ten years.\" Anyway, it just, I know if people haven\\'t experience that, it\\'s just impossible to imagine. But at eighteen, I remembered that I was sexually abused. And I only remembered little snippets of it, but I talked to my mom [Ruby Page Schwimmer] about it. But it wasn\\'t until I had my own daughter that it started to become a real problem for me. So I just shut it down, I just, my mom said, \"Don\\'t think about it.\" I said, \"Okay.\" But once I had my own daughter, the pain started to bubble up in many ways, and I didn\\'t realize that that was what was happening at first. But things like, when she would come home after school, I would black out. Because that\\'s when I would be abused, is every day when I came home from school, and he was there and my mother was at work. And so there were, there were things--and I say blackout. Like, we\\'d be playing and I would just fall asleep. And I didn\\'t, this would repeatedly happen in the middle of the afternoon. And it\\'s, you know, it\\'s crazy stuff is happening, and the anxiety was coming up, and it took me a while to put together what it was. And that if I wanted to be a mother, I needed to treat it. And I think that\\'s one of the things when I look back, my mother never did the healing work. And that\\'s part of the reason why she missed all the signs and she couldn\\'t, you know, and I realized, if I don\\'t do my healing work, my daughter could be abused and I might fall asleep and miss it. (Laughter) You know? So I was motivated to do the work. And some people, you know, I am a strong person of faith. And I think for me, at that time, I was working on my prayer life a lot, and that gave me the strength to do the work. But I don\\'t believe, some people believe if you just forgive the past, and pray, you\\'re done. I had to do more than that. Maybe that works for some people, but I had to go to therapy, I went to a hypnotist that took me back, so that\\'s why I know that it ended when I was seven. I\\'m sorry, you asked me, \"How did it end?\" And I know this because I went into therapy and because I did the hypnosis. Gosh, this is hard. So he had been abusing me for years. He had been playing little sex games with me after school, when I would come home from school. And, and, especially when I was in kindergarten, you know, I\\'d get home earlier than my brothers and sisters. You know, he was able to have time alone with me. And I think one of the unwritten rules was that no one spoke. That you didn\\'t speak when these things, the unspeakable, right? Because nobody spoke. When I was seven, I said something and he immediately stopped his activities and left, and it never happened again. Okay, this is the really hard part. So in the hypnosis, I had to go back and relive some of these things. And it was very judicious about the healing. About--because what you\\'re trying to do is go back and unpack what happened, and what you learned to believe because of the things that happened. And you want to be able to undo that process of creating false beliefs about yourself and about the world. And, which would be things like you don\\'t matter, and you don\\'t have any value, and your value is only as to pleasure somebody else, you know? You have to undo all these beliefs. I felt like it was a process of, like the Greek myth, when Hercules goes back into Hades and goes in to save someone and pull them out. That I had to do these therapy sessions, to go back and find this child and bring them out of Hell. It was a very difficult period. Story_ID: 521603 Speaker 1: But reliving that memory of the last time he sexually abused me (crying), the most horrible part about it is that the child became very depressed. Because as a child, I was sad that the abuse stopped. Because it was a feeling of affection and warmth and love and it was, I don\\'t know, it was normal. It was what was there. And so I thought I had done something wrong. That was the third grade, and I got all Cs in third grade. I was always a straight A student through my whole life, and I remember I got all Cs in third grade. And I think, I never put it together, until much later, until I did this hypnosis and I understood. I became a very depressed child because I had done something wrong and I was being punished by my stepfather [Paul Cremaschi]. And, any sane adult human who looks at that and says, \"How can you twist a young child into somebody who would become depressed when it stops?\" It\\'s horrible (crying). Speaker 2: Did you find yourself angry with your mother [Ruby Page Schwimmer]? Speaker 1: Not until after she died. My mother was an amazing person. It\\'s so funny, given what I\\'ve shared with you. It\\'s gonna be hard to reconcile with that, with the fact that she was an educator. She was looking after everyone\\'s children. She was the principal of many schools, and she made a very positive difference in not only the lives of the students who were there, but the teachers and the parents. She died at age sixty-seven, and at her funeral, over three hundred people came and spent hours telling my brother [Wayne St. John] and my sister [April St. John Keenoy] and I what she had done for them. And how much she had done for them. That she had kept kids in school who, you know, gotten them off drugs and somebody said, \"She helped me find a husband.\" You know, or parents, \"She helped me get back in school.\" Or teachers, \"She helped my further degree.\" And, you know, she did so much for so many people. But when you look back, she was a very, you know, her life, her childhood was so horrible, she was fighting with demons. When I was growing up, she used to take us to motivational speakers, she used to spend hours writing affirmations. Writing positive statements over and over again. So what I learned from her was that her life was messy and painful, but she fought to try to stay more positive. She didn\\'t always win, but she fought for more positivity for herself, for her children, you know, even though, okay, she made this one really big mistake with marrying Paul Cremaschi, and not being able to see the signs. But she filled our house with books. She made us love education. She supported our interests, whether it was skiing or my brother\\'s photography. He built a--he\\'s a photographer now. He built, she bought him his first enlarger to develop pictures, at a pawn shop. You know, and helped him build a dark room in the garage, and she gave us so much. It\\'s--at her funeral, my brother\\'s speech, he said, \"She was the best of moms, and she was the worst of moms. But she was never in between.\" So I valued my relationship with her. When she turned sixty, I took her to England for a week, we spent a week in England together. Shortly before she died, I got to speak on a Disney cruise [Disney Cruise Line] and I took her with her. She loved, me with her, she loved Disney [The Walt Disney Company], and Roy Disney [Roy E. Disney] was on the ship. And Jennifer Hudson was singing on the ship, and it was an amazing trip. I loved my mother and I wanted that relationship. But after she died, I think I was willing, I was willing to admit more things to myself. And it\\'s like what I said about when my stepfather died. You\\'re willing to go down roads that you didn\\'t go down for many years. When my mother died, it felt like, you know if you took a beach ball, and you pushed it under the water, and then you took your hand away, it would shoot up? That\\'s what it felt like to me, is that there was all this stuff that had been pushed down for so long, and it shot up after she died, and I couldn\\'t stop it. So I was, I had a lot of anger after she died that I had to process. But I didn\\'t share that with her. Story_ID: 521604\\n\\nReference 3 - 1.01% Coverage\\n\\nSo I leaned, and then I said, \"I don\\'t want nothing. I can do this on my own. I\\'m gonna look cool. I\\'m gonna be cool. I\\'m gonna be like everybody else,\" you know. And when I had my daughter [Darcy Deane], and then the pain of the sexual abuse started coming up, I couldn\\'t do it on my own anymore, and the pain was so intense. I was going through that process of going back over the memories, and doing the healing, and I was still a mom. And I would have to come back and be a mom, dry my tears, and come back and be a mom, or go and give a motivational speech for everybody. And because I had to hold it together for my daughter, sometimes when I would fly to another city to give a speech, that was when I could break down and cry, and just let the pain out. And I remember I was in a hotel room, and I was supposed to give a speech, and I was laying on the bed and just sobbing. And just--the pain was just coming over me so much, I couldn\\'t get off the bed. I couldn\\'t get up. And I remember, I just said, \"Help me, God.\" And it was like it lifted and I could get off the bed. And that was a moment for me that I thought, this is real. This isn\\'t talking to your invisible friend, God is real, and I want to know more about that. And so, having to go through that difficult healing process really brought me back to God and really helped me, inspired me to explore my relationship with prayer. And so it was because of that that I ended up writing the book, \\'How Strong Women Pray\\' [Bonnie St. John]. Because I developed my prayer life, I\\'d started to get more of a relationship with God.\\n\\nReference 4 - 1.36% Coverage\\n\\n Speaker 2: So I left the White House [Washington, D.C.], and went home, and I got pregnant and had Darcy [Darcy Deane] and started a business. So I thought this was a good idea. To quit my job, get pregnant, and start a business, all at the same time. It was very difficult. It was kind of like that first week of skiing. It was very, very challenging. I was exhausted, I only had like twenty hours of babysitting, and was, you know, so starting a business was really slow. I quickly realized, most entrepreneurs were working sixty hours a week, you know. And I was working, maybe fifteen, you know, hours a week. And so things that would take an entrepreneur a week, it would take me a month. And so it was slow going, and it was exhausting, and I was a new mother, which we know is hard. Plus, I was starting to have a lot of the anxiety issues about the sexual abuse, and so it was hard getting started, but I wouldn\\'t trade it for anything, because I was able, I had always--when I was in fourth grade, I was writing my first book [\\'Succeeding Sane: Making Room For Joy In A Crazy World,\\' Bonnie St. John]. I had always wanted to write books. And reading books had been my solace. I read books on the playground when other girls were playing double Dutch jump rope and hopscotch, and I couldn\\'t do what they were doing, I would sit and read a book. And I would travel on adventure. I would be a superhero in the book \\'cause I couldn\\'t do it on the playground. And I would read a Nancy Drew book in one night. I would go in the bathroom and turn the light on and stay up and read a book, you know, at night. They were my escape venue. My, where I could dream, where I could be someone bigger or better. I could explore a mental world. And so I always wanted to write because books had given me so much. I wanted to do that. So getting to start my own business, get my first book contract with Simon and Schuster [Simon and Schuster, Inc.], write a book and then be at home, you know, in the afternoons and I could teach my daughter to swim in the pool and take her for walks in the park, and I was able to create a life for myself that I wanted. \\n\\nReference 5 - 0.43% Coverage\\n\\nSpeaker 2: So when Darcy [Darcy Deane] was five, I--we got divorced. And that was very difficult. I talk about that in the book, \\'How Strong Women Pray\\' [Bonnie St. John].

And Darcy\\'s father [Grant Deane] is a wonderful person, but in the end, we decided that it--we needed to get a divorce, and it was a very painful decision as it always is. But we worked through it we, we did a lot of therapy. We did a lot of trying to do it in a good way and still to be able to jointly parent Darcy, which we do. We do, in fact, with the home schooling, he did half of the \\n\\nReference 6 - 0.77% Coverage\\n\\nSpeaker 1: The other part is this resilience.

And so the next book that we have coming out is called \\'Micro-Resilience\\' [\\'Micro-Resilience: Minor Shifts for Major Boosts in Focus, Drive, and Energy,\\' Bonnie St. John and Allen P. Haines]. And Allen [Allen P. Haines] is co-authoring it with me. He\\'s actually gonna get his name on the cover this time. Not just to do all the work, but actually get his name on the cover. And it\\'s taking many of the things I learned, coping with healing from sexual abuse, staying motivated, being an athlete. There\\'s a lot of science, there\\'s a lot of things that I read along the way about that. We went back and scoured the literature, the current literature, and found even more things. And micro-resilience is a set of tools.

Interestingly though enough, I went to college and my first year I moved into the dorm--while I lived--while I was at Loyola [University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], I still stayed on campus. And I moved in with two white seniors and another girl who was a freshman, who was, who was white. She was actually Greek. And I think it was more of an experience for them than me, cause I just showed up. I mean, I had been to Mother McAuley [Liberal Arts High School, Chicago, Illinois]; I was use to it. But this was their first time ever being around an African-American. So, I spent my first year getting adjusted to that--having them get adjusted to it. And it turned out to be beautiful relationships. Had a bad first year, my mom [Lovie Spann] was--had gone into the hospital suffering from alcoholism--dealing with her personal issues, and I had gotten raped, my freshman year of, of college. And, so, that was probably--that was--it was a bad--it was a rough year, cause Latrice was young (simultaneous) Speaker 2: Sounds like it was a traumatic year. Speaker 1: It was a very traumatic year, but a year of growth. Because you wonder everyday, you know, how do you go on dealing with all of this. But it, it was for a reason, I was, I was just being made. I was, you know, I'm not bitter because of it, or.... I tell you that because I want people to understand that I was not exempt from tragedy, or you know, traumatic things. I haven't lived this fairytale type life.

But anyway, so I have this contrast of experiences.\\n\\n'), ('UNCTWMS_Garcia_Serena', '> - ¤ 1 reference coded  [11.96% Coverage]\\n\\nReference 1 - 11.96% Coverage\\n\\nI had a godmother, a black woman, who was very much in her senior years. At that time seniors would be more than willing to take care of neighborhood kids. At the same time there were certain things that, if they felt like they had trust of other people who were around them, they just did. This person that&#8217;s in their family, they just know they can trust them. They would think that the perpetrators would be living down the street or homeless or someone who may have a mental illness or someone who is a substance abuser. So I was very much protected by the outside community, but as we know, in 2011, oftentimes the perpetrator is not going to be that same stranger from down the street or somebody that you just come in contact with. Sometimes and oftentimes it&#8217;s going to be someone that you know and someone who&#8217;s been brought into the family. When you look at some of the stories that Anne Rice [author of the novel, Interview with the Vampire] created for the New Orleans area and you look at the entr&#233;e of the vampire, [for] the vampire to come into a person&#8217;s home, that person has to open the door. The person has to open the door, and the same thing happened with me. By virtue of me not having the protective systems in place, the door was open for the vampire to come in. When the vampire comes in then, they prey. That&#8217;s what they do. So that&#8217;s exactly what happened. I was eight years old and it went on continuously, with this one person who was a relative of my godmother, for the next two years. So I suffered in silence, and to be very honest, at that age, the way that I rationalized what was happening&#8212;I knew it was wrong&#8212;but when I looked at the situation at eight years old and saw how me and my grandmother were living, which was not extreme poverty but still very low income to where we couldn&#8217;t afford certain services or health care or a car or air conditioning or things like that. Because she had to work so much to try to take care of our rent and she was often gone, [I was] in the care of the landlord sometimes, and the landlord was the relative of my godmother, and they had a son that was considerably older than me. He was already a young man when I was only eight years old. So by my godmother thinking that this family member was going to be someone that she could trust and that we could trust, oftentimes when she turned her back she put me in the care of him and delivered me right into the hands of the vampire. So that meant complete and full access. But because his father was our landlord, I felt the responsibility for maintaining our house was bent on me taking the responsibility for providing for the needs that he had in mind. Even though they were wrong needs, I still felt like it was my responsibility to keep a roof over our head, and so that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t say anything. That&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t tell. CGD: So what happened to stop the abuse at ten? SG: He finally moved away. It wasn&#8217;t going to stop on its own. I didn&#8217;t have the wherewithal to stop it and I was too fearful to tell the family. For one, for fear of us losing our home, and number two, for fear of them not believing me. I&#8217;m this little biracial child who has extremely low value in the community as it is, so what value do I have? This is my thinking at eight years old, obviously, and so the only reason why it stopped was because he went to college. That was the only reason why it stopped. That was the only reason why it stopped, and I didn&#8217;t disclose it to my family on my mother&#8217;s side until I was getting ready to graduate from high school. There was a mental blockage of it for some number of years. Sometimes when children go through extreme psycholog[ical] trauma they block things out. They block out memories in their mind, and they&#8217;re blocked out for so long. As I began my teenage years, becoming a young woman, I think the way that began to manifest itself was in substance abuse. That&#8217;s how it began to manifest itself. It didn&#8217;t manifest itself in terms of sexual promiscuity by any means. I was extremely selective and very protective about that. In fact after the first time that I had sex with someone I went to my dad immediately and told him that he needed to get me on the birth control pill like tomorrow, because I&#8217;d just started having sex last night. After my dad passed out&#8212;. [Laughs] CGD: How old were you? SG: I was sixteen. I was sixteen years old and I gained strength sometime during that time frame, as I mentioned to you before, to confront my perpetrator. I found the strength to do that after I had enlisted into the military and I knew what I was going to do with my life and I felt empowered somehow. I saw him on the street one day. He came back and I saw him and stopped him, and I very boldly announced to him, &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to do this again. You had the opportunity to do it without any consent from me whatsoever, but I&#8217;m sixteen years old now. It&#8217;s been eight years; I dare you to try now. I dare you to try it now. I&#8217;m taking everything back and I&#8217;m not going to be silent anymore. I&#8217;m going to start telling people about it, and you can call me a liar if you want to but it&#8217;s the truth. I&#8217;m not going to allow you or any other man or any other person to silence me again and take my liberties from me. I&#8217;m going to always put that in the forefront of my agenda from now on, so thank you for that.&#8221; Right after that is when I decided that I wanted to start having consensual sex, and so again the early feminist in me decided to choose my own partner. I chose my own partner. It wasn&#8217;t someone I was in love with, it wasn&#8217;t someone that I felt very intimately about or was in love with or had any kind of romantic relationship [with]. There was someone that I thought would be the best fit for me, no pun intended. So I went up to my male friend and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to have sex tomorrow, and if you&#8217;re ready, let&#8217;s get condoms and let&#8217;s go.&#8221; He looked at me and said, &#8220;Well don&#8217;t you want the sweet romantic stuff and the candles and the soft music and the Keith Sweat playing in the background?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Keith Sweat is not needed. I&#8217;m ready to have consensual sex and either you&#8217;re going to be my partner or I&#8217;m going to find somebody else,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Okay, well I guess I&#8217;ll go ahead [Laughs] and get myself together.&#8221; So that was yet again another instance of being sexually liberated, even outside of being a survivor of child sexual molestation. I was able to yet again find a way to empower myself and take control of my sexuality, and my health also by going to my dad and announcing to him very strongly and boldly, &#8220;I need to be on the pill and I need for you to take me. You haven&#8217;t done anything else for me. I need you to do this. At least protect me from having children that I know I can&#8217;t take care of.&#8221; My grandmother was completely against the idea of me being on the pill because she was Catholic and so she was very much a conservative[ly] minded woman from the standpoint of family planning and pregnancy prevention. So I went to somebody who I knew would say yes. I cornered him [Laughs] into saying yes. So that was my upbringing, coming up as a young woman. \\n\\n'), ('HM_Harris-Perry_Melissa', '> - ¤ 1 reference coded  [7.78% Coverage]\\n\\nReference 1 - 7.78% Coverage\\n\\n Speaker 2: So, I was in college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina] and doing all this activism, and, or what I understand to be activism, campus protests, you know, kind of campus as a laboratory, all of that is around race. We are identified, in fact, we threw campus Kwanzaa every year, we saw ourselves as bringing racial presence to the campus. I did, I did almost nothing with women\\'s organizing on campus. Now, I took women\\'s studies classes, I read bell hooks, but I, in my actual work I did almost nothing around womens\\'--unless it was black womens--work with an emphasis, probably, on the racial aspect of it. It was really in graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina] when I started to identify with two important things; one, that I was a rape survivor which, although it occurred before I ever even left to go to college, I\\'m really rare--I don\\'t know that I ever really talked about it in college. I certainly hadn\\'t even disclosed it to my own parents [William M. Harris, Sr. and Diana Gray] until senior year, maybe even, either senior year of college or first year of graduate school before I even disclosed that it had happened, even though it happened when I was fourteen. I just did not talk about it with any--when I was 14, I told one person, a friend, and no one else until I was about 20. And so, as I started engaging both my own kind of personal healing around it, started to disclose it, started to think of it as part of my identity as being a sexual assault survivor, that draws you into doing women\\'s work in a different way and I also started reading a lot of work by African American women who were rape survivors and, of course, almost all of us are survivors of rape at the hands of men who are black, because everyone is most likely to be sexually assaulted within the context of their own race. It\\'s not that men are most, that black men are most likely to be rapists, but they are most likely to be the rapists of black women, just as white men are most likely to be the rapists of white women. The--\"We must save the endangered black man, we must rally all together, our unity is more important than anything else\"--starts to fall apart when you are willing to be very honest about the amount of intra-racial gender violence, and it was something that even though I had experienced it, I just hadn\\'t dealt with it or thought about it, or theorized about it, or put it in the context of my work, and once I started doing that, it forced me to say, \"Okay, how do I love the race? How do I talk about this notion of black masculinity and black manhood, but have a place to talk about what happened to me at the hands of a black man.\" And, the more that I did that and the more that I started, you know, you start just following, I try to get my students to read this way--you read one thing and that person mentions something and then you can read that person since you are kind of, you know, doing this intellectual history just through reading what the people that you\\'re reading are reading--and when I started to\\ndo that, all of a sudden I realized, Oh, my God! Every time people would say, I could remember conversations in college where we would say how bad slavery was, in part because black women were raped, and if black women were raped that meant black men could not protect their women. I could remember these conversations as though the main victim of rape is the man, whose manhood is somehow damaged by this. I can remember us saying in Kwanzaa, like, \"We must protect the black woman who is our community\\'s greatest resource.\" Ahhh--she is the community, like, push her over as the resource in part, because black sororities and fraternities come out of an era of uplift. There is also a lot of weird, like gendered stuff that goes on about being \"the backbone,\" so even though Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] is this black woman\\'s organization, also sometimes reproduces a respectability politics that still has a relatively constrained notion for who black women are, and so you learn those things as mantras that you repeat because you\\'re proud of the organization, and it wasn\\'t until I start reading some of the critiques that I was like, \"Oh, yeah, woah. That is a problem.\" So it really, it was this kind of personal moment of changing my identity from, like pan-Africanist, nationalist, black girl, to pan-African nationalist black girl rape survivor, to \"Oh-wait a minute, that is going to have to change my whole analysis,\" and so by the time, and, I\\'m also by the way encountered Wahneema Lubiano, who made me read a whole bunch of other things and also just made me stop saying certain kinds of things and I met my very best girlfriend [Blair Kelley], who is the second half of my brain and she has never been anybody\\'s nationalist nothing, and so she critiqued and she challenged. She is a historian, actually a dean at North Carolina State [University in Raleigh, North Carolina] right now, so, as a historian she would push back against some of the kind of ahistorical, racial things I would say and so some of it was my identity, some of it was my friendship, some of it was what I was reading, but, you know, by the time five years of graduate school passed, I had a very, very different world view. Story_ID: 564909 Speaker 1: So I want to go back, you mention that you are a rape survivor and you didn\\'t tell your parents [William M. Harris, Sr. and Diana Gray] for a long time. Speaker 2: I don\\'t, still never told my father. I mean, he watches the show so I guess he knows, but I never said it to my father, yeah. Speaker 1: Did your family know this person? Speaker 2: He was our neighbor, which is why I did not tell, so this was after we had moved and my mother had gone through a lot to buy the home, so this is the first time we lived in a single family home. It was the first home that she herself had purchased and bought, and the fact we built it. Not a fancy house, just very basic, but it was the home that she built. A nice little, you know, neighborhood, still two, my two best friends in high school [Thomas Dale High School in Chester, Virginia] lived in that same neighborhood. This man, his backyard, so we were a corner lot, his backyard abutted ours, and he was a father, African American man, married, was a father of two children and lived there all through my high school, (not my, he wasn\\'t there in high school) high school years, college years. I finally told, I might be getting this timing a little wrong, I think I told junior or senior year of college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina]. I told my mom and then, and it was because she kept bugging me. Some mail for him had come to our house and she kept asking me, I was home on summer or Christmas break, and she kept asking me to take it over to him and I wouldn\\'t and I\\'m not, I mean, I\\'m rebellious but I\\'m not disobedient like that and she could not under--and finally, she was like, \"Take the mail over!\" and I spilled why I wouldn\\'t. Of course, at that point, so much time had passed no one at that point was talking and we just didn\\'t do anything legal, but then, and this now, I\\'m sure I\\'ve got the timing right on this. This, the second year of graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina], and this is hard to believe but he actually hit me in the face. He was walking. In certain ways this galls me even more because, like, all right, but I was standing in my front yard, it was Christmas, I was coming home. He was walking his dog past our front yard. The dog comes into the yard to use the bathroom, which I just saw as --- and so I screamed at him to get his dog off my yard because--Jesus!-- and then he screamed back, came into the yard, we got into each other\\'s face, and he hit me. So I called the police for that! Right? End up in court and telling the judge who this person is to me, what he had done to me, and the judge, (unclear) judge says, \"well, I mean, I don\\'t know anything about that, if there is any report of anything like that; this just sounds like neighbors and so go home and be nice to each other.\" And, basically you know my mom\\'s enjoyment of that neighborhood ended from the time that she knew, so she had enjoyed and loved her neighborhood, she is a gardener, she always loved to garden, but like her garden was the line of their property and so it really, so, part of the reason I never told was because sure enough, once I did and once that happened, it just made the whole experience for everyone there very, very ugly and awful, and it wasn\\'t long after that, after the court thing happened, because even though the judge did nothing, his wife heard me say what I said and people who rape teenagers, grown men who do that, are not single-time perpetrators. It\\'s never true, and I suspect that as the wife she also understood that he had probably perpetrated in other circumstances, whatever those were, because very shortly thereafter their marriage broke up and the family moved, but yeah, and again, I talk about being a survivor on air, but I have never had a conversation with my father about it.\\n\\n'), ('SCAARJ_Mingus_Mia', '> - ¤ 1 reference coded  [1.68% Coverage]\\n\\nReference 1 - 1.68% Coverage\\n\\nSo my work is in two broad pieces. My work is disability justice, so I apply it all the time there, and then I do transformative justice work. So in that work, I feel likeÌ¢åÛåÓThe transformative justice work that I do is around community responses to child sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse is very, very pervasive, and just as the statistics that weÌ¢åÛåªre given say that people who are identified or assigned as girls are twice as likely to be victims of child sexual abuse, the same statistics are true around disabled children and adults, because thereÌ¢åÛåªs also developmental stuff that gets complicated. But actually, in terms of gender, we actually think itÌ¢åÛåªs much moreÌ¢åÛåÓwe think itÌ¢åÛåªs much higher around people who get assigned as boys, too, but that thereÌ¢åÛåªs less reporting. So itÌ¢åÛåªs hard to know. I feel like my TJ [transformative justice] around child sexual abuse, or CSA, work is disability justice work, because I know so many people who are survivors of child sexual abuse who are disabled peopleÌ¢åÛåÓmyself includedÌ¢åÛåÓand I know so many people whoÌ¢åÛåÓI know that disabled communities donÌ¢åÛåªt talk it. No communities talk about child sexual abuse. So itÌ¢åÛåªs not just disabled communities, but given the prevalence, I think that itÌ¢åÛåªs something that disabled communities should be talking about and that most disabled children donÌ¢åÛåªt have access to community, donÌ¢åÛåªt have accessÌ¢åÛåÓThereÌ¢åÛåªs just so many more complications around disabled children, I feel like, that get added in around dependency and all that, so I feel like disability justice is certainly a huge piece of that work, too.\\n\\n'), ('BWSP_Gardner_Martha', '> - ¤ 1 reference coded  [3.27% Coverage]\\n\\nReference 1 - 3.27% Coverage\\n\\nGardner: Barbara Tannenbaum talking about how it was so important to her that a day like this was happening when she felt like she was always trying to deal with rape and harassment on campus, and people don\\'t always listen or seem to notice and it\\'s so important that women are getting together and showing how much this has to do with and how big this issue was even going on at the time. It was very important to them and they spoke first. And then, I can\\'t remember exactly when the microphone started working, but pretty soon the microphone started working [Laughter]. And um we had someone holding an umbrella for the speaker a lot of the time, people switching off holding the umbrella for the speaker. Um, I wish I could remember who spoke first, but I was one of the first, maybe one of the twelve speakers. And I talked abo\\nt harassment I had gotten written on my door that year. I had a \"Closets Are for Clothes\" sign on my dorm room door, I was living in West Quad, I was a Woman Peer Counselor, and someone had written on it, \"Rot in hell, you dyke and I\\'m going come back and rape you because I know you need to be satisfied, you smegma queen.\"\\x9d Lamoree: Wow.

And I remember there were some fraternity guys that when I was talking about lesbian/gay stuff kind of off to the right who like jeered, you know, which was really, you know, that but all those women there, it was like this complete juxtaposition right in front of me. So that went on. But as the first twelve people spoke, people started piling up, and uhÌ¢åÛå? we expected it to last for an hour and it lasted until five or five-thirty. People justÌ¢åÛå?. And I stayed the whole time, I didn\\'t necessarilyÌ¢åÛåÓI didn\\'t plan to spend my afternoon there, and it was just this feeling of people realizing how huge this all was, you know, and Third World women talking about their experiences and how they were different, but related, and how sometimes they got delegitimized in the community because people were always, because racism needs to dealt with and so sometimes the sexism stuff kind of fell behind.
