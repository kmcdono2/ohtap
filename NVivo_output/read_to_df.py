DESCRIPTION-------
Example code for reading NVivo coded content from an NVivo extract into a pandas dataframe. 
Here we read in two files, one containing an extract of all NVivo coding except errors (everything_but_errors_12-22-20.xls), and 
another containing only the error coding (errors_12-22-20.xls). The code itself is trivial and the important points are contained in the NOTES.

NOTES-------
1) dependencies: the df.read_excel() in pandas uses the xlrd package internally, so you need to pip or conda install xlrd
2) need to export the NVivo extract as an .xls file 
  - NOT .xlsx, because for some reason xlrd now only supports the older .xls file type
  - NOT .csv because some cell values (description, coded text, maybe others) can contain commas and it is a hassle to work around this
3) df.read_excel() cannot read the .xls file as directly exported from NVivo (NVivo's exported .xls file is malformed according to .read_excel()'s requirements)
So as a workaround, you can "repair" NVivo's .xls file by doing the following (but the .xls files contained in ohtap/NVivo_output/data are already repaired, so 
no need to do this step unless you are working with .xls files you exported yourself from NVivo):
   -open up the .xls file that was exported from NVivo in some spreadsheet software (I used mac's Numbers application, but Google Sheets or Excel would probably work too)
   -re-export the opened file as another .xls file (which will now be well-formed for .read_excel()). In the Numbers application, what you do precisely is
     + navigate to File -> Export To -> Excel...
     + under "Advanced Options" change file type to .xls
     + in the Excel Worksheets field, select "One Per Table" and nothing else (in particular, unselect "Include a summary worksheet" if that was selected by default")
     + click next and save the repaired file where you want
