I think he has done a lot of good things, and people just don't know because they can't hear it because they see and hear other things that he says. And I think it is important for him to really get people to understand who he really is and about. It might not be important to him as it is for us or for me in particular, but I think he has some things that he can let our community know so they just don't always hear that hard line. That, that's one thing and that's one thing that I've shared with him because I think that's important. I think Condi Rice [Condoleeza Rice] is absolutely fabulous. I think that people respect her for who she is. She is brilliant, knows what she's doing, and I don't think she always follows that hard line. Again, and if she does, it's the way it's presented and I think that some of our black Republicans that are hard lines that people may know like Clarence Thomas or whatever, it's all how we present, you know, and all how we carry our self and all how we give to the community or don't, and people don't see him giving to the community. They see him following that hard line just so he can be a token or whatever people might want to call him because I'm sure you've heard those names that they call him. But, I think there's more to him than that if he just would reach out a little bit more I think that would help. Story_ID: 70034 Speaker 1: What, what would you--do you have maybe an example of something that maybe he [Clarence Thomas] has done. I, I don't what to make this just about him, but you mentioned that he's done some things that pe--people don't know about. Are those in the context of being a Supreme Court Justice? Speaker 2: I think there, there's a couple of things. I think some of his decisions are right on time. You know looking at them and stuff like that and I try to keep up with it 'cause I like history and, and things like that that go on. I think one thing is like a personal thing or family thing where he's, you know, adopted or taken in one of his relative's child because they just couldn't do it. Because we always as black folks tend to take care of each other and our families or we used to a lot, but that's something that people may not know, and this kid loves Clarence Thomas"

Now-- Speaker 2: He was at that time--Clarence was at that time was on the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]. He was, he was-- Speaker 1: Right, yeah. Speaker 2: --he was with EEOC and he, you know, he had worked here, he had worked here in, in Missouri, in fact he had stayed for a while with Margaret, with Margaret Wilson [HistoryMaker Margaret Bush Wilson]. Speaker 1: He had stayed a summer with her and--yeah. Speaker 2: Yeah. So when he was with the EEOC, and so he also was--see Thurgood [Thurgood Marshall]--Thurgood you see (unclear), that was fine. So when he was nominated Jack Danforth [John Danforth] who was a senator here and the Danforths were at that time--were then friends. Jack called me and asked me about supporting Clarence Thomas and I said, ""I don't know,"" 'cause I want to know how he is on civil--on affirmative action. There was some event at the White House [Washington, D.C.], I think maybe a couple of days later or something and I was there and so was Clarence and I raised the question with him, I said, ""What is your position on civil rights, on, on affirmative action?"" And, and so he said that he was being misquoted and he wanted to have and I don't know what I was there for maybe it was for Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] but whatever but anyway I was--and so he said he would want to come over and at least bring me up to date so that I wouldn't be confused about it. He actually came over and we had breakfast together the next morning and he brought me a lot of information showing his support for affirmative action and civil rights. So therefore I decided on the basis of this that I would not oppose him. Bill Taylor [William L. Taylor] called me and he said--if you know Bill Taylor but anyway, but anyway, he said he was going to oppose him. I said, ""I met with him and he went over, he is supportive of affirmative action."" So I did not support--I did not oppose him. I, I did not--Margaret I think went in and gave testimony for him or something, but I didn't do that but I just did not oppose him. And so of course they knew that I didn't oppose him because I was asked to do a petition or something opposing him but I did not oppose him. So he was then confirmed there was, and whatever his first opinion was I got a call, I don't know who the black reporter was who called me and said, ""Well what do you think"" and I said, ""All I can say is I'm disappointed,"" and that's all, that's all I could say. (Laughter) So I have not--I haven't seen Thomas since that time and, and I just haven't, you know, but anyway-so I did not oppose him, I did not oppose him, because he convinced me that he was not against affirmative action and he showed me all this stuff.

So, the first year I got a 4.0. The next year I had a 3.0, and now I'm still doing the same type of work. And so, one of my supervisors, a brother, said that's a pattern, you're gonna get a 2.0 and you're gonna be out the door. So you better start fighting. In the meantime, he started doing all kinds of things to me, having me investigated and just all kinds of crazy stuff. Trying to remove me. You know, with all the years' service I had and so. You know, I just started fighting him and it went to Clarence Thomas and Clarence Thomas sent it to an outside person in Virginia to investigate. And of course it came back just terrible on his part. And Clarence saved me. He agreed with the outside investigator. He didn't have to do that. They can say anything they want. I disagree, she's out the door, you know. So, but I have not heard that he was a bad chairman. Because once you're in the field you don't have the same connections in Washington [D.C.]. I don't know of too many people that he had removed.

And I worked as an accounting clerk for, well, I worked for, as a clerk for about three or four years and then I moved up to, I was the accounts payable supervisor and then, and then from that I went to work for the foundation [Playboy Foundation]. So I was six years doing that stuff. And it turned out I had a facility for it that I didn't know. Working with the numbers was, seemed to be easier, you know, 'cause it, it allowed me to use the side of the brain while I could still use the other side, so. Speaker 2: Yeah. (Unclear) when I saw it on the outline I was kind of surprised 'cause I, I said, well, she has no training in accounting that I could see but, you know, I was gonna ask you where, where you got your secret accounting training (laughter)? Speaker 1: I just learned it. And yet, I, and that's what I'm saying it surprised me, you know, and it, I ended up, you know doing the books for the whole company. It was, it was, it was pretty interesting, but I could, you know, I could do it, I don't know if that's the left or the right brain, but I could, I could do it and it wouldn't interfere, with my, my artistic, my creative side. Story_ID: 611308 Speaker 1: You started working with Playboy [Playboy Enterprises, Inc.] when Playboy was a, really a big-- Speaker 2: Yeah Speaker 1: --deal. Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--they, they were, they had, they had the Playboy Building [Palmolive Building] there on Walton [Street] and they had, they were on eight floors 'cause, and, and I mean, complete floors of work and, you know, the beautiful women and it was, it was a lot of good parties (laughter). Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember the, the bunny rabbit thing, neon bunny rabbit dominated the Chicago [Illinois] skyline at one point (unclear) the rabbit coming up by the Drake Hotel [Chicago, Illinois]. Speaker 2: No. It was just the words Playboy. Speaker 1: No, they actually had an outline of a rabbit head with the ears-- Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah! On the Drake side. Speaker 1: Right. Years, I remember that. So, so if you drove by you'd see it. Now, so people would probably want to know, so I'm gone ask, what was the work culture like working for Playboy? Speaker 2: It was great actually and, you know, from the outside, especially when I came to the foundation [Playboy Foundation] I would run into feminists and like how could you work there and stuff like that. But everybody there was incredibly nice. It was a great collection of, of creative people, of people who were a little left of center, you know. It--we--it was, because it was a political decision, it wasn't for me, but for a lot of people to take that job, you know. It was a political decision so they were, they weren't ordinary people to me and anyway that, that's the way they seemed. And I just enjoyed it. I, you know, it became my family. You know, I've helped, I have friends who I met there that are friends today. You know, that'll be the friends for the rest of my life, actually. And it's a terrific springboard for people. Speaker 1: Okay, so, so the place is kind of left of center and know the community, organizing community for years would pass out the Playboy interview with Saul Alinsky to everybody. Speaker 2: You know, they did, you know, the interview with Malcom X, you know. Alex Haley did the first interviews in Playboy magazine, period, you know. And his first interview was with Miles Davis. So, you know, then he went on to do all, you know, all the famous ones, the top ones but, they, you know, they did, they interviewed Fidel Castro, you know, they, they had lots of that. And at the same time, you know, they were giving their money to very political causes. So it was, it was good to be part of that."

I'm not sure about the date, but I think it's that same summer. But I was at a luncheon meeting here in St. Louis [Missouri] for some civil and community group, and seated next to me was the attorney general of Missouri, Danforth [John Danforth]. And while we were in the midst of table conversation, he said to me, ""By the way, you would be interested in knowing that I'm bringing a young man out from Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] to be on my staff in the Attorney General's Office."" He was then attorney general. I said, ""Oh."" And he said, then he said, ""And he's African American."" I said, ""Oh, very good."" And we went on to the--then he came back and he said, ""Getting back to that young man I was talking about, do you know any place where he could stay in St. Louis while he's studying for the bar this summer? I'm not sure, sure Jefferson City [Missouri] is very exciting for a young man, you know."" And without a moment's hesitation, I said, ""Sure."" He said, ""Where is that?"" I said, ""In my home,"" (laughter), and he said, ""Oh."" Well, it turns out my son [Robert E. Wilson III] was not coming home for the summer. My son was in his, finish, had just finished his first year in Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]--I think it was, yeah--and he was gonna work in Washington [D.C.] in the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] office. He had gotten a job, and he was gonna live--so he wasn't coming home, and I was brokenhearted (laughter). So here comes this question from the attorney. I said, ""He could stay in Robert's room, and it's fine, and then I'll have me a young person in the house."" And so I was delighted, never seen Clarence in my life, didn't know him, you know, nothing. But the, the attorney general had recommended him. I had confidence that he was of good character and all that, so I said, ""Yes."" And he said, ""Well, where is that?"" I said, ""In my home."" He said, ""Really?"" I said, ""Sure."" I said, and I had told him that my own son was not coming home. And so that's how it happened. I had never seen Clarence, didn't know a thing about him. And then I didn't hear any more from Danforth, and I had kind of put it in the back of my head. And one day in May the doorbell rang. And I went to the door, and there at the door was somebody who looked like an African prince. And I said ah, bet this is Clarence Thomas (laughter). So I opened the door and here was this deep basso--you know, he's got a deep basso voice even then. And he said, ""My name is Clarence Thomas."" I said, ""I know, and I've been expecting you. Please come in,"" (laughter). And that's how it started. Story_ID: 357936 Speaker 1: He, he stayed in Robert's [Robert E. Wilson III] room; and a very disciplined person. Robert had some weights (unclear) weights. They were down the (unclear). One day I heard a huge noise upstairs, and here is Clarence [Clarence Thomas] doing the weights up in the bedroom. I said, ""Oh no, Clarence, we can't--you have to go down in the (unclear) to do that,"" (laughter). But that was the only time. But he, he spent the summer. And I had only one requirement: be home for dinner at six o'clock, for us to have dinner at six o'clock. And my then ailing ex-husband [Robert E. Wilson, Jr.] was also there 'cause he was, had emphysema, and I was kind of looking after him for that. And we used to have dinner every evening at the dining room table. And my husband and Clarence would have these knock-down-drag-out arguments about first one thing and another (laughter), you know. It was great fun. And he stayed all summer, from that time until he got ready to go up to--and when he got ready to leave, he said to me, ""How much do I owe you?"" I later learned he didn't have a quarter. (Laughter) He couldn't have paid me. I said, ""Clarence, you don't owe me a thing. I want you to make me one promise."" He said, ""What's that?"" I said, ""If you are ever in a position to help some young persons or persons like I have done for you, I want you to do it."" And we shook hands, and he went on his way. And now, you know, he's on the Supreme Court of the United States, incredible, incredible.

Oh, yes I think that the best geography lesson that I ever got was the war listening to the news reports and it involving practically all of Europe and the Pacific Rim and that sort of thing and then the Mediterranean area, I got to know a lot about Africa and Europe and Asia and I depend on that geography lesson even today. Do you remember particular battles, do you remember hearing about the Jimmy Doolittle raid or That was an exciting thing And the news reels at the movies showing them with those B-25s taking off of those aircraft carriers. Oh man, that was great stuff Yes, that was one of the first really big morale builders I think for the country. It was kind of a show thing. Then, it was really a serious attack on the country. We realized that, but we also realized that the Japanese have been hitting us pretty hard with their aircraft carriers and so forth in the Pacific, but we could reach them. And that was a big boost. 10 Sherman D. Bigbee Sherman D. Bigbee What about D-Day? Was there an apprehension about it? Well, it was happening. It wasn t something that we could anticipate that it was going to happen, but we knew that it was coming and when they announced it, there was a lifting, I think, but at the same time, there was great dread. The news coming from Normandy was mixed. We did get through the first day and were still on the beaches, but the casualty toll was, well, horrible; much anticipation particularly on the part of those families in the community that had soldiers in the invasion and waiting to hear whether they had survived the initial attack or not was a very anxious time for everybody."

It was a crisis nursery, where if one were to feel kind of at wit s end, had any concern that that crisis they were facing might end up with in any way neglecting or abusing their child, they could remove their child from that risk by simply taking them to Rainbow House. Rainbow House was a crisis nursery that was open 24/7. They just simply had to make a phone call to the taxi company with whom we had a partnership, the cab would pick them up and take them over to the Rainbow House, which was our partnership with the Tulsa what was called Vo-tech at that time. We had staff there that would care for them 24/7 until this crisis could be dissipated and the parent could come back for them. And then when parents would come back we could refer them to different education programs, different community resources, all to help them maybe prevent that kind of situation from happening again, or for knowing where to go and how to access establish community services should that situation arise again. Unfortunately Rainbow House was probably ahead of its time. That was at a time, I remember clearly, where the subject of child abuse wasn t even acceptable social conversation."

(Laughs) You know, it s hardly ever the cause. It s sometimes being able to find the funding to continue the cause. The Child Abuse Network I don t know if you know about it. If you don t mind could I take just a minute to say, the Child Abuse Network is for child abuse there s a spectrum of services. There s prevention and then there s the prosecution of perpetrators. Child Abuse Network is involved only when the abuse has actually been reported, and so our work is to aid in the termination of abuse and then to aid in the assessment and the prosecution of the perpetrators. It s a very unique, and hopefully less unique as years go by, because hopefully it will be replicated. I already told you it s replicated in Israel. It s a co-location of the police department s child crisis unit, the DHS s children s protection unit, the OU Medical Clinic pediatrics unit, and the District Attorney has an office there. It s a wonderful co-location of people who 20 will deal with determining if there s been abuse and going after the perpetrator, if the abuse is proven. It s an expensive venture, because of the co-location of all those agencies, and child abuse still, it s a lot easier just to pick em up and lock em up, instead of do the forensic evidence and all that, which ultimately saves tax payer money and is more fair to all the parties involved and really protects the children."

It might not be important to him as it is for us or for me in particular, but I think he has some things that he can let our community know so they just don't always hear that hard line. That, that's one thing and that's one thing that I've shared with him because I think that's important. I think Condi Rice [Condoleeza Rice] is absolutely fabulous. I think that people respect her for who she is. She is brilliant, knows what she's doing, and I don't think she always follows that hard line. Again, and if she does, it's the way it's presented and I think that some of our black Republicans that are hard lines that people may know like Clarence Thomas or whatever, it's all how we present, you know, and all how we carry our self and all how we give to the community or don't, and people don't see him giving to the community. They see him following that hard line just so he can be a token or whatever people might want to call him because I'm sure you've heard those names that they call him. But, I think there's more to him than that if he just would reach out a little bit more I think that would help.

Speaker 2: I think there, there's a couple of things. I think some of his decisions are right on time. You know looking at them and stuff like that and I try to keep up with it 'cause I like history and, and things like that that go on. I think one thing is like a personal thing or family thing where he's, you know, adopted or taken in one of his relative's child because they just couldn't do it. Because we always as black folks tend to take care of each other and our families or we used to a lot, but that's something that people may not know, and this kid loves Clarence Thomas"

So when he was nominated Jack Danforth [John Danforth] who was a senator here and the Danforths were at that time--were then friends. Jack called me and asked me about supporting Clarence Thomas and I said, ""I don't know,"" 'cause I want to know how he is on civil--on affirmative action. There was some event at the White House [Washington, D.C.], I think maybe a couple of days later or something and I was there and so was Clarence and I raised the question with him, I said, ""What is your position on civil rights, on, on affirmative action?"" And, and so he said that he was being misquoted and he wanted to have and I don't know what I was there for maybe it was for Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] but whatever but anyway I was--and so he said he would want to come over and at least bring me up to date so that I wouldn't be confused about it. He actually came over and we had breakfast together the next morning and he brought me a lot of information showing his support for affirmative action and civil rights. So therefore I decided on the basis of this that I would not oppose him. Bill Taylor [William L. Taylor] called me and he said--if you know Bill Taylor but anyway, but anyway, he said he was going to oppose him. I said, ""I met with him and he went over, he is supportive of affirmative action."" So I did not support--I did not oppose him. I, I did not--Margaret I think went in and gave testimony for him or something, but I didn't do that but I just did not oppose him. And so of course they knew that I didn't oppose him because I was asked to do a petition or something opposing him but I did not oppose him. So he was then confirmed there was, and whatever his first opinion was I got a call, I don't know who the black reporter was who called me and said, ""Well what do you think"" and I said, ""All I can say is I'm disappointed,"" and that's all, that's all I could say. (Laughter) So I have not--I haven't seen Thomas since that time and, and I just haven't, you know, but anyway-so I did not oppose him, I did not oppose him, because he convinced me that he was not against affirmative action and he showed me all this stuff.

And so, one of my supervisors, a brother, said that's a pattern, you're gonna get a 2.0 and you're gonna be out the door. So you better start fighting. In the meantime, he started doing all kinds of things to me, having me investigated and just all kinds of crazy stuff. Trying to remove me. You know, with all the years' service I had and so. You know, I just started fighting him and it went to Clarence Thomas and Clarence Thomas sent it to an outside person in Virginia to investigate. And of course it came back just terrible on his part. And Clarence saved me. He agreed with the outside investigator. He didn't have to do that. They can say anything they want. I disagree, she's out the door, you know. So, but I have not heard that he was a bad chairman. Because once you're in the field you don't have the same connections in Washington [D.C.]. I don't know of too many people that he had removed.

Years, I remember that. So, so if you drove by you'd see it. Now, so people would probably want to know, so I'm gone ask, what was the work culture like working for Playboy? Speaker 2: It was great actually and, you know, from the outside, especially when I came to the foundation [Playboy Foundation] I would run into feminists and like how could you work there and stuff like that. But everybody there was incredibly nice. It was a great collection of, of creative people, of people who were a little left of center, you know. It--we--it was, because it was a political decision, it wasn't for me, but for a lot of people to take that job, you know. It was a political decision so they were, they weren't ordinary people to me and anyway that, that's the way they seemed. And I just enjoyed it. I, you know, it became my family. You know, I've helped, I have friends who I met there that are friends today. You know, that'll be the friends for the rest of my life, actually. And it's a terrific springboard for people. Speaker 1: Okay, so, so the place is kind of left of center and know the community, organizing community for years would pass out the Playboy interview with Saul Alinsky to everybody. Speaker 2: You know, they did, you know, the interview with Malcom X, you know. Alex Haley did the first interviews in Playboy magazine, period, you know. And his first interview was with Miles Davis. So, you know, then he went on to do all, you know, all the famous ones, the top ones but, they, you know, they did, they interviewed Fidel Castro, you know, they, they had lots of that. And at the same time, you know, they were giving their money to very political causes. So it was, it was good to be part of that."

I said, ""He could stay in Robert's room, and it's fine, and then I'll have me a young person in the house."" And so I was delighted, never seen Clarence in my life, didn't know him, you know, nothing. But the, the attorney general had recommended him. I had confidence that he was of good character and all that, so I said, ""Yes."" And he said, ""Well, where is that?"" I said, ""In my home."" He said, ""Really?"" I said, ""Sure."" I said, and I had told him that my own son was not coming home. And so that's how it happened. I had never seen Clarence, didn't know a thing about him. And then I didn't hear any more from Danforth, and I had kind of put it in the back of my head. And one day in May the doorbell rang. And I went to the door, and there at the door was somebody who looked like an African prince. And I said ah, bet this is Clarence Thomas (laughter). So I opened the door and here was this deep basso--you know, he's got a deep basso voice even then. And he said, ""My name is Clarence Thomas."" I said, ""I know, and I've been expecting you. Please come in,"" (laughter). And that's how it started. Story_ID: 357936 Speaker 1: He, he stayed in Robert's [Robert E. Wilson III] room; and a very disciplined person. Robert had some weights (unclear) weights. They were down the (unclear). One day I heard a huge noise upstairs, and here is Clarence [Clarence Thomas] doing the weights up in the bedroom. I said, ""Oh no, Clarence, we can't--you have to go down in the (unclear) to do that,"" (laughter). But that was the only time. But he, he spent the summer. And I had only one requirement: be home for dinner at six o'clock, for us to have dinner at six o'clock. And my then ailing ex-husband [Robert E. Wilson, Jr.] was also there 'cause he was, had emphysema, and I was kind of looking after him for that. And we used to have dinner every evening at the dining room table. And my husband and Clarence would have these knock-down-drag-out arguments about first one thing and another (laughter), you know. It was great fun. And he stayed all summer, from that time until he got ready to go up to--and when he got ready to leave, he said to me, ""How much do I owe you?"" I later learned he didn't have a quarter. (Laughter) He couldn't have paid me. I said, ""Clarence, you don't owe me a thing. I want you to make me one promise."" He said, ""What's that?"" I said, ""If you are ever in a position to help some young persons or persons like I have done for you, I want you to do it."" And we shook hands, and he went on his way. And now, you know, he's on the Supreme Court of the United States, incredible, incredible. And about, oh, I could get the date off of the--I got an award from the bar association of St. Louis [Bar Association of Metropolitan St. Louis]. And they had the ceremony out at the art museum [Saint Louis Art Museum, St. Louis, Missouri]. I think it was the art museum. And I went, you know, to get my award. And I kind of glanced, and I said oh, that does look like Clarence Thomas. You know, I just glanced at this guy, was in--and then I went on and then--but it was Clarence Thomas. He came all the way out here for that (laughter) bar association event without telling me, and he was in the audience. (Laughter) I can't--every time I think about it I get flabbergasted. A United States Supreme Court justice comes to my ceremony getting--and it was just wonderful."

Oh man, that was great stuff Yes, that was one of the first really big morale builders I think for the country. It was kind of a show thing. Then, it was really a serious attack on the country.

It was a crisis nursery, where if one were to feel kind of at wit s end, had any concern that that crisis they were facing might end up with in any way neglecting or abusing their child, they could remove their child from that risk by simply taking them to Rainbow House. Rainbow House was a crisis nursery that was open 24/7. They just simply had to make a phone call to the taxi company with whom we had a partnership, the cab would pick them up and take them over to the Rainbow House, which was our partnership with the Tulsa what was called Vo-tech at that time. We had staff there that would care for them 24/7 until this crisis could be dissipated and the parent could come back for them. And then when parents would come back we could refer them to different education programs, different community resources, all to help them maybe prevent that kind of situation from happening again, or for knowing where to go and how to access establish community services should that situation arise again. Unfortunately Rainbow House was probably ahead of its time. That was at a time, I remember clearly, where the subject of child abuse wasn t even acceptable social conversation."

(Laughs) You know, it s hardly ever the cause. It s sometimes being able to find the funding to continue the cause. The Child Abuse Network I don t know if you know about it. If you don t mind could I take just a minute to say, the Child Abuse Network is for child abuse there s a spectrum of services. There s prevention and then there s the prosecution of perpetrators. Child Abuse Network is involved only when the abuse has actually been reported, and so our work is to aid in the termination of abuse and then to aid in the assessment and the prosecution of the perpetrators. It s a very unique, and hopefully less unique as years go by, because hopefully it will be replicated. I already told you it s replicated in Israel. It s a co-location of the police department s child crisis unit, the DHS s children s protection unit, the OU Medical Clinic pediatrics unit, and the District Attorney has an office there. It s a wonderful co-location of people who 20 will deal with determining if there s been abuse and going after the perpetrator, if the abuse is proven. It s an expensive venture, because of the co-location of all those agencies, and child abuse still, it s a lot easier just to pick em up and lock em up, instead of do the forensic evidence and all that, which ultimately saves tax payer money and is more fair to all the parties involved and really protects the children."
